## ACT I

### SCENE 1 ‚Äî EXT. GREASE CANYON ‚Äî DUSK
Neon smog boils over mountains of **discarded fry boxes** and **glowing soda cans**. A warped **carnival organ** wheezes somewhere unseen.

A **PINK KETCHUP BOTTLE**, half-buried, catches dying light.

A SHADOW pads in: **KETCH** ‚Äî scruffy mutt, one floppy ear, collar tag: *‚ÄúPINK KETCHUP ‚Äî THE FUTURE OF FUN.‚Äù*

Ketch noses the bottle. Looks skyward.

**KETCH (V.O.)**  
They called me lucky.  
(beat)  
Then they changed the label.

He gnaws the cap, savoring like a relic‚Äî  
A distant **MECHANICAL HUM** cuts the moment in half. The HUM carries the faint **smell of burning sugar**, acrid and wrong.

---

### SCENE 2 ‚Äî INT. DUMPSTER KINGDOM ‚Äî NIGHT
A **cardboard fortress** and **Happy Meal toy** battlements under sputtering Christmas lights. A cracked **snowglobe**: smiling pink bottle inside ‚Äî centerpiece of a **shrine**.

A broken billboard flickers. Neon static forms a face.

**BILLBOARD (glitched, whisper)**  
Dip deep, little nugget.

Ketch tilts his head. Mustard growls from the shadows: **MUSTARD**, one-eyed raccoon, bandana crooked.

**MUSTARD**  
Static. Don‚Äôt listen.

(FLASH: Younger Ketch hauling a smoke-scorched raccoon pup from fire. Her hiss through the smoke. Two survivors.)

A RAT scuttles over a fry box. Ketch salutes like a soldier.

**INDUSTRIAL ROAR.** The walls tremble. Lights die.

Ketch peers through a crack, fur bristling.

---

### SCENE 3 ‚Äî EXT. GREASE CANYON SKY ‚Äî NIGHT
A swarm of **HEINZ DRONES** descends ‚Äî glossy, black. Logos flicker: **Heinz**, **McDonald‚Äôs**, and a third sigil ‚Äî a **melted crown**, unreadable.

They ferry a crate: **‚ÄúPINK KETCHUP ‚Äî LIMITED RUN.‚Äù**

Centerpiece: the **HEINZ BOTTLE DRONE**, bottle-shaped, camera-eyes blinking. Voice: reverent, soft, void.

**HEINZ BOTTLE (V.O.)**  
Catalog.  
Contain.  
Conserve.

As it speaks, a mist of **preservative spray** drifts down, leaving a sterile tang in the air.

---

### SCENE 4 ‚Äî EXT. CANYON RIDGE ‚Äî CONTINUOUS
The **snowglobe** slips, cracks, bleeds glitter.

Ketch freezes ‚Äî one breath ‚Äî then **runs**.

---

### SCENE 5 ‚Äî EXT. FRY DUNES ‚Äî NIGHT
Ketch vaults into his **shopping-cart buggy**: roller-skate wheels, duct-taped boom box, broomstick column. Sparks spit.

Above: the Heinz Bottle lowers the crate like an altar offering.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**  
Preservation is mercy.  
Without mercy, the tongue dies of choice.

**NETS/TETHERS** drop. Ketch zigzags through exploding fries. The air smells like scorched potato oil.

A **RUSTED SCOOTER** rockets in ‚Äî **MUSTARD** riding, one eye blazing.

**MUSTARD**  
You buying a ticket, mutt ‚Äî or just whining at the band?

They collide; then, together, pick up speed.

---

### SCENE 6 ‚Äî EXT. INDUSTRIAL PLATFORM ‚Äî NIGHT
The Heinz Bottle lands on a glowing platform. **ROBOTIC DISCIPLES** in tie-dye aprons hum.

Ketch and Mustard cling to a railing, eyes on the crate.

**KETCH (whisper)**  
That‚Äôs it. The last one.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**  
To share flavor‚Ä¶ is to invite chaos.

A wave of ketchup fog spreads, **sticky strings clinging** to walls and fur.

**SEALS** click. A glow leaks.

Ketch lunges ‚Äî teeth on a glowing **ampoule of pink**. Drones swarm. Mustard claws in beside him.

**MUSTARD (shouting)**  
You don‚Äôt fetch, dog. You reclaim.

They swing over a canyon of beige static.

**HEINZ BOTTLE (lower, hypnotic)**  
Little relic, pink curdles.  
Beige endures.  
Choose the archive.  
Be remembered. Be embalmed.

Ketch‚Äôs jaw knots. He **spits** the ampoule upward.  
It arcs: **pink, radiant, impossible**.

**MUSTARD (screaming)**  
KETCH‚Ä¶ UP!

**SMASH CUT:** **TITLE CARD: KETCH‚Ä¶ UP!**

**CUT TO BLACK.**

---

### SCENE 7 ‚Äî EXT. SERVICE ROAD TO NOWHERE ‚Äî NIGHT
The buggy rattles a broken road. Ketch limps; Mustard pushes.

**MUSTARD**  
That stunt? Cute. Almost heroic.  
(beat, softer)  
Don‚Äôt make it your brand.

Ketch hears the care under the burr. They walk into neon dark.

**END OF ACT I**

---

## ACT II

### SCENE 8 ‚Äî EXT. FRYWAY GAUNTLET ‚Äî NIGHT
Abandoned interstate. Billboards like tilted gravestones. As they speed past, each **flickers alive**.

**BILLBOARD #1 (holo waitress)**  
Hungry? Smile for the combo!

**BILLBOARD #2 (cartoon clown)**  
Where‚Äôs your receipt? Receipts guarantee salvation!

Mustard steers with one paw.

**MUSTARD**  
Never trust a sign that talks back.

Drones descend. Spotlights cut smog.

**HEINZ BOTTLE (broadcast)**  
Return the anomaly.  
Tonight the tongue forgets color.  
Tomorrow it thanks me for forgetting.

Ketch slaloms fallen fry-trucks. Mustard climbs a pole and **kicks** a screen ‚Äî it **glitches**.

Other boards chime in, fracturing:  
**BILLBOARD CHORUS**  
Why preserve? Why play? Why laugh?

Drones hesitate, trying to catalog dissent. Ketch veers hard.

**MUSTARD (yelling)**  
That‚Äôs right! Argue yourselves into paperwork!

They blast through while drones loop in debate.

### SCENES 9‚Äì11 ‚Äî THE TRIPLE DIP (MERGED GAUNTLET) ‚Äî NIGHT
*A single escalating sequence that fuses Sameness, Infinite Variety, and the beckoning Void.*

#### 9A ‚Äî SAUCEWAY JUNCTION
The interstate softens into a **faintly pink road** pulsing like a vein. The **ampoule** hums in Ketch‚Äôs jaws, synced.

**KETCH (V.O.)**  
It‚Äôs pointing. Calling.

**MUSTARD**  
That‚Äôs not a road. That‚Äôs a trap with curb appeal.

A voice like warm thunder trembles the air.

**SAUCE FATHER (V.O., infinite)**  
Ketch‚Ä¶ the platter waits.  
The dip is deep.

As the voice speaks, pink sauce stains across the road swirl into the shape of a **dinner plate halo**. It fades.

**KETCH**  
Did you hear that?

**MUSTARD**  
Yeah. I heard you talking to yourself. Real persuasive.  
(beat)  
Another billboard whisper. Same scam, bigger font.

**MUSTARD**  
Fine. We follow the glowing artery of doom.  
(softer)  
If it eats us, mutt‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm haunting you.

Ketch smiles ‚Äî fragile, stubborn ‚Äî leads on.

## FINAL TAGLINE  
**‚ÄúThe world didn‚Äôt end with a bang.  
It ended with a laugh track.  
And a little pink.‚Äù**
