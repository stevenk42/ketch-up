## ACT I

### SCENE 1 ‚Äî EXT. GREASE CANYON ‚Äî DUSK
Neon smog boils over mountains of **discarded fry boxes** and **glowing soda cans**. A warped **carnival organ** wheezes somewhere unseen.

A **PINK KETCHUP BOTTLE**, half-buried, catches dying light.

A SHADOW pads in: **KETCH** ‚Äî scruffy mutt, one floppy ear, collar tag: *‚ÄúPINK KETCHUP ‚Äî THE FUTURE OF FUN.‚Äù*

Ketch noses the bottle. Looks skyward.

**KETCH (V.O.)**  
They called me lucky.  
(beat)  
Then they changed the label.

He gnaws the cap, savoring like a relic‚Äî  
A distant **MECHANICAL HUM** cuts the moment in half.

---

### SCENE 2 ‚Äî INT. DUMPSTER KINGDOM ‚Äî NIGHT
A **cardboard fortress** and **Happy Meal toy** battlements under sputtering Christmas lights. A cracked **snowglobe**: smiling pink bottle inside ‚Äî centerpiece of a **shrine**.

A broken billboard flickers. Neon static forms a face.

**BILLBOARD (glitched, whisper)**  
Dip deep, little nugget.

Ketch tilts his head. Mustard growls from the shadows: **MUSTARD**, one-eyed raccoon, bandana crooked.

**MUSTARD**  
Static. Don‚Äôt listen.

(FLASH: Younger Ketch hauling a smoke-scorched raccoon pup from fire. Her hiss through the smoke. Two survivors.)

A RAT scuttles over a fry box. Ketch salutes like a soldier.

**INDUSTRIAL ROAR.** The walls tremble. Lights die.

Ketch peers through a crack, fur bristling.

---

### SCENE 3 ‚Äî EXT. GREASE CANYON SKY ‚Äî NIGHT
A swarm of **HEINZ DRONES** descends ‚Äî glossy, black. Logos flicker: **Heinz**, **McDonald‚Äôs**, and a third sigil ‚Äî a **melted crown**, unreadable.

They ferry a crate: **‚ÄúPINK KETCHUP ‚Äî LIMITED RUN.‚Äù**

Centerpiece: the **HEINZ BOTTLE DRONE**, bottle-shaped, camera-eyes blinking. Voice: reverent, soft, void.

**HEINZ BOTTLE (V.O.)**  
Catalog.  
Contain.  
Conserve.

---

### SCENE 4 ‚Äî EXT. CANYON RIDGE ‚Äî CONTINUOUS
The **snowglobe** slips, cracks, bleeds glitter.

Ketch freezes ‚Äî one breath ‚Äî then **runs**.

---

### SCENE 5 ‚Äî EXT. FRY DUNES ‚Äî NIGHT
Ketch vaults into his **shopping-cart buggy**: roller-skate wheels, duct-taped boom box, broomstick column. Sparks spit.

Above: the Heinz Bottle lowers the crate like an altar offering.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**  
Preservation is mercy.  
Without mercy, the tongue dies of choice.

**NETS/TETHERS** drop. Ketch zigzags through exploding fries.

A **RUSTED SCOOTER** rockets in ‚Äî **MUSTARD** riding, one eye blazing.

**MUSTARD**  
You buying a ticket, mutt ‚Äî or just whining at the band?

They collide; then, together, pick up speed.

---

### SCENE 6 ‚Äî EXT. INDUSTRIAL PLATFORM ‚Äî NIGHT
The Heinz Bottle lands on a glowing platform. **ROBOTIC DISCIPLES** in tie-dye aprons hum.

Ketch and Mustard cling to a railing, eyes on the crate.

**KETCH (whisper)**  
That‚Äôs it. The last one.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**  
To share flavor‚Ä¶ is to invite chaos.

**SEALS** click. A glow leaks.

Ketch lunges ‚Äî teeth on a glowing **ampoule of pink**. Drones swarm. Mustard claws in beside him.

**MUSTARD (shouting)**  
You don‚Äôt fetch, dog. You reclaim.

They swing over a canyon of beige static.

**HEINZ BOTTLE (lower, hypnotic)**  
Little relic, pink curdles.  
Beige endures.  
Choose the archive.  
Be remembered. Be embalmed.

Ketch‚Äôs jaw knots. He **spits** the ampoule upward.  
It arcs: **pink, radiant, impossible**.

**MUSTARD (screaming)**  
KETCH‚Ä¶ UP!

**SMASH CUT:** **TITLE CARD: KETCH‚Ä¶ UP!**

**CUT TO BLACK.**


---

### SCENE 7 ‚Äî EXT. SERVICE ROAD TO NOWHERE ‚Äî NIGHT
The buggy rattles a broken road. Ketch limps; Mustard pushes.

**MUSTARD**  
That stunt? Cute. Almost heroic.  
(beat, softer)  
Don‚Äôt make it your brand.

Ketch hears the care under the burr. They walk into neon dark.

---

**END OF ACT I**

---

## ACT II

### SCENE 8 ‚Äî EXT. FRYWAY GAUNTLET ‚Äî NIGHT
Abandoned interstate. Billboards like tilted gravestones. As they speed past, each **flickers alive**.

**BILLBOARD #1 (holo waitress)**  
Hungry? Smile for the combo!

**BILLBOARD #2 (cartoon clown)**  
Where‚Äôs your receipt? Receipts guarantee salvation!

Mustard steers with one paw.

**MUSTARD**  
Never trust a sign that talks back.

Drones descend. Spotlights cut smog.

**HEINZ BOTTLE (broadcast)**  
Return the anomaly.  
Tonight the tongue forgets color.  
Tomorrow it thanks me for forgetting.

Ketch slaloms fallen fry-trucks. Mustard climbs a pole and **kicks** a screen ‚Äî it **glitches**.

Other boards chime in, fracturing:

**BILLBOARD CHORUS**  
Why preserve?  
Why play?  
Why laugh?

Drones hesitate, trying to catalog dissent. Ketch veers hard.

**MUSTARD (yelling)**  
That‚Äôs right! Argue yourselves into paperwork!

They blast through while drones loop in debate.

---

### SCENES 9‚Äì11 ‚Äî THE TRIPLE DIP (MERGED GAUNTLET) ‚Äî NIGHT
*A single escalating sequence that fuses Sameness, Infinite Variety, and the beckoning Void.*

#### 9A ‚Äî SAUCEWAY JUNCTION
The interstate softens into a **faintly pink road** pulsing like a vein. The **ampoule** hums in Ketch‚Äôs jaws, synced.

**KETCH (V.O.)**  
It‚Äôs pointing. Calling.

**MUSTARD**  
That‚Äôs not a road. That‚Äôs a trap with curb appeal.

A voice like warm thunder trembles the air.

**SAUCE FATHER (V.O., infinite)**  
Ketch‚Ä¶ the platter waits.  
The dip is deep.

**KETCH**  
Did you hear that?

**MUSTARD**  
Yeah. I heard you talking to yourself. Real persuasive.  
(beat)  
Another billboard whisper. Same scam, bigger font.

**MUSTARD**  
Fine. We follow the glowing artery of doom.  
(softer)  
If it eats us, mutt‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm haunting you.

Ketch smiles ‚Äî fragile, stubborn ‚Äî leads on.

---

#### 9B ‚Äî THE MAYO MARAUDERS (TEMPTATION OF SAMENESS)
... (continues)


#### 9B ‚Äî THE MAYO MARAUDERS (TEMPTATION OF SAMENESS)
Engines roar. **MAYO MARAUDERS** crest a hill ‚Äî white leather, squeeze-helmets, tires spraying grease. At front: **DUKE MAYONNAISE**, bloated, pompous, chest scrawled **SMOOTH IS PEACE**.

They encircle.

**DUKE MAYONNAISE**  
Hand over the pink relic. Join us.  
The blandness will keep you safe.  
No spice. No bite. Just‚Ä¶ calm.

**MUSTARD**  
Calm? Your silence is sticky.

**DUKE MAYONNAISE**  
The bite divides.  
Smoothness unites!

**CHANT (wet, squelchy)**  
Smoothness unites! Smoothness unites!

Ketch wavers.

**KETCH**  
Maybe we should‚Äî

**MUSTARD**  
Don‚Äôt finish that sentence.

A mayo whip snaps Ketch‚Äôs ear. The buggy fishtails through goo. Mustard leaps to a bike, **yanks** a helmet ‚Äî rider spins into a **tower of barrels**.  
**BURST.** A flood of white.

**DUKE MAYONNAISE (roaring)**  
You will drown in gentleness!

Ketch guns the buggy. Mustard dives back in, dripping.

**MUSTARD**  
If I die smelling like egg salad‚Äî  
I‚Äôm haunting everyone.

They race up a tilted sign and **LAUNCH**, leaving curdled wreckage.

---

#### 9C ‚Äî THE SAMPLERS (TEMPTATION OF INFINITE VARIETY)
The Sauceway opens to a crater: a crashed **UFO SAUCE DISPENSER** dripping into a prismatic **pool**. Wanderers dip bread, eyes glassy. **THE SAMPLERS.**

**SAMPLERS (chanting, glitchy)**  
Dip. Repeat. Forget.  
Dip. Repeat. Forget.

A robed **PRIEST** approaches, ladle dripping.

**SAMPLER PRIEST**  
Welcome, stray. Welcome, scar.  
Infinity awaits. Dip once ‚Äî you‚Äôll never stop dipping.  
That‚Äôs the gift.

Ketch, trembling:

**KETCH**  
Every flavor‚Ä¶

He lowers his muzzle. Reflection: his old mascot form, eternally smiling, endlessly dipping fries. A frozen crowd cheers. His tail wags once, uncertain.

Mustard **slaps** the ladle away.

**MUSTARD**  
Every flavor is the same as no flavor.  
It‚Äôs noise. And you know it.

**SAMPLER PRIEST**  
Blasphemy! To refuse the infinite‚Äî

**MUSTARD**  
‚ÄîIs to survive the hangover.

She drags Ketch back. He pants, torn.

**KETCH (whisper)**  
It‚Äôd be easier‚Ä¶ to stay remembered.

**MUSTARD**  
And rot in sugar? Not my mutt.

They back away. The pool blinks shut like an eye.

---

#### 9D ‚Äî THE VOID (HEINZ WHISPER)
Billboards freeze; smog hushes. The Heinz hologram floats at the edges, voice like sleep.

**HEINZ BOTTLE (holo)**  
Release. Forget taste. Forget pain.

Ketch trembles‚Äîthen steels.

**KETCH (V.O.)**  
I remember the carnival lights dying mid-jingle.  
The fryer hiss like rain.  
I licked the floor for warmth.  
Tasted dust.

He clutches the ampoule tighter. They move on.

---

### SCENE 12 ‚Äî EXT. SAUCEWAY / COSMIC OVERLOOK ‚Äî NIGHT
*(Unchanged ‚Äî the Cosmic Hand, the Source, Mustard‚Äôs snark remain intact.)*

---

### SCENE 13 ‚Äî EXT. SAUCEWAY EDGE ‚Äî NIGHT
Ketch presses his cracked **collar tag** into Mustard‚Äôs paw ‚Äî it glints faintly pink.

A drone lunges for the ampoule. Mustard snarls, **bats** it away, clutching the glass despite herself.

**MUSTARD (hissed)**  
Nobody breaks it but me.

The buggy rattles forward. Mustard‚Äôs temper snaps.

**MUSTARD**  
You lost your brand, your dance, your pride.  
Now you want a cosmic gravy boat to tell you you‚Äôre special.

**KETCH**  
It meant something. It colored lives.

Mustard‚Äôs eye burns.

**MUSTARD**  
Colored mine in red.  
The *sizzle* ‚Äî sweet as candy.  
A voice smooth as oil: *‚ÄúHarmony is sticky, little one.‚Äù*  
My mother‚Äôs scream tasted like corn syrup.  
The floor was *slippery* with it.  
I licked my paw for weeks.  
Still taste the **lie**.

(beat; she shoves the tag back to him)  
Don‚Äôt die, mutt. I hate how quiet it‚Äôd be.

She leaps off, swallowed by shadow.

**KETCH**  
Mustard! Wait!

Silence.

---


### SCENE 14 ‚Äî EXT. FRY REFINERY ‚Äî NIGHT
Towers rain hot oil. Mascot-workers shovel forever. Drones net Ketch, pry the **ampoule** free.

**HEINZ BOTTLE (descending)**  
Efficiency has found you.  
Harmony is sticky, little one.

(Cut: Mustard in shadow, frozen. The exact lie again. Her jaw sets. Rage eclipses fear.)

**MUSTARD (snarling, emerging)**  
I told you. I still taste the lie.

She barrels in on a stolen **conveyor cart**, rebels at her back.

**MUSTARD**  
Miss me, relic?

She smashes drones, grease everywhere, cuts Ketch free.

**KETCH**  
You came back.

**MUSTARD**  
Don‚Äôt flatter yourself. I came back to punch ketchup.

The Bottle rises, titanic.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**  
Then so be it.  
The archive declares war.

Tendrils unfurl. The floor quakes.

---

### SCENE 15 ‚Äî INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER OF CONDIMENTS ‚Äî NIGHT
Hidden in ruins: a **round table** of grotesque **avatars**.  
**MAYO** (order), **RANCH** (smothering nostalgia), **SRIRACHA** (bite). Others flicker and merge ‚Äî **RELISH+BBQ** into one smoky-sweet **NOSTALGIA** archetype.

They tempt:

**NOSTALGIA**  
I‚Äôll keep memory crisp. I‚Äôll bind your heart in smoke.

**SRIRACHA**  
Burn. Prove you live.

**RANCH**  
I‚Äôll smother everything. Safe. White. Eternal.

Ketch staggers.

**KETCH**  
Maybe pink isn‚Äôt enough.

Mustard slams a paw.

**MUSTARD**  
Different sauces. Same collar.

(beat)  
You‚Äôre not carrying pink for them.  
You‚Äôre carrying it for everyone.

Ketch centers.

**KETCH**  
I don‚Äôt pick one.  
I fight for them all.

Avatars **glitch**, collapse into puddles.

---

### SCENE 16 ‚Äî EXT. BILLBOARD PLAIN ‚Äî NIGHT
The Heinz Bottle blots the horizon. Tendrils sweep, draining color.

Factions rally:

**MAYO MARAUDERS**  
For smoothness!

**SAMPLERS**  
For the dip!

**REBELS**  
FOR FLAVOR!

**HEINZ BOTTLE**  
Then drown.

The sky **cracks**. War begins.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

---

**END OF ACT II**

---

## ACT III

### SCENE 17 ‚Äî EXT. SAUCEWAY MUSTER ‚Äî NIGHT
Carts, scooters, fry-wagons idle under a bruised sky. The **SAUCEWAY** glows ‚Äî runway to fate.

Ketch tightens his ragged collar. Mustard checks her bent **syrup wrench**.

**MUSTARD**  
If you leap again, mutt ‚Äî I‚Äôm not scraping you off the pavement.

Ketch almost smiles.

**KETCH**  
I‚Äôll‚Ä¶ dance around the dying part.

A shadow spreads. They look up.

The **HEINZ BOTTLE** rises colossal, stitched from billboards, tendrils uncoiling.

**HEINZ BOTTLE (booming, calm)**  
Tonight the tongue forgets color.  
Tomorrow it thanks me for forgetting.

Engines growl. A nod between them.

**KETCH**  
We ride through.

They kick off. The charge begins.

---

### SCENE 18 ‚Äî EXT. SAUCEWAY / WAR OF FLAVORS ‚Äî NIGHT
Neon chaos:

‚Äî A **tiny chihuahua in a chef‚Äôs hat** skates a broken tray, hurling fries like daggers.  
**CHIHUAHUA (barking)**  
Once more unto the breach, dear friends! For flavor!

‚Äî **Mayo Marauders** lob jars; white bursts on red tendrils.  
‚Äî **Samplers** sling rainbow ladles that hiss through drone armor.  
‚Äî **Fry-workers** catapult baskets of molten fries like meteor showers.

Tendrils sweep highways into beige; color drains in **waves**.

Ketch steers through falling signs. Mustard stands braced, wrench a metronome.

**MUSTARD**  
Drones first! Don‚Äôt sermonize the skyline!

**HEINZ BOTTLE**  
Relic. Surrender novelty. Be safe.

A tendril snags the buggy; Ketch slashes into a collapsing sign ‚Äî **SNAP** ‚Äî free.

Mustard clocks him, grudgingly impressed.

**MUSTARD**  
Okay, bones. That was almost poetry.

They crest a ridge ‚Äî see it: a pulsing **VORTEX** ‚Äî the **SOURCE OF SAUCE** ‚Äî pink light breaking seams in the air.

---

### SCENE 19 ‚Äî EXT. ASCENT TO THE SOURCE ‚Äî CONTINUOUS
The Sauceway narrows into a **spiral bridge of light**. The buggy rattles onto it. The world falls away.

The Heinz Bottle hauls up the spiral like a living skyscraper. Screens die to black; only its winter eyes remain.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**  
Pink fades.  
Beige endures.

Engines behind falter. Only **Ketch and Mustard** climb.

**MUSTARD**  
Hey. If you leap‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll be the one yelling.

**KETCH**  
Then I‚Äôll leap toward the sound.

The **ampoule** flares, nearly blinding.

---

### SCENE 20 ‚Äî EXT. BRIDGE TO THE SOURCE ‚Äî CONTINUOUS
A tendril **slams** across the bridge. The buggy skids sideways, sparking over the void.

They scramble off. The Bottle lowers its massive face. Billboards in its skin go black, swallowing reflections.

**HEINZ BOTTLE (near-whisper, everywhere)**  
Be remembered.  
Not lived.

Ketch stares into the vortex.

**KETCH**  
Tell me it matters.

Mustard‚Äôs good eye shines, finally unguarded.

**MUSTARD**  
It matters if we make it matter.

Ketch nods ‚Äî a vow.

---

### SCENE 21 ‚Äî EXT. THE LEAP ‚Äî NIGHT
Tendrils lash, wrapping Ketch‚Äôs chest and legs, dragging him back. He refuses to drop the **ampoule** ‚Äî jaw iron.

Mustard hurls herself in, wrench smashing, claws tearing. A tendril **snaps**, red spray into star-dark.

For a heartbeat, Ketch is free.

A low hum swells ‚Äî **SAUCE FATHER** on the wind.

**SAUCE FATHER (V.O., warm thunder)**  
Leap, child.  
The platter is waiting.

Ketch runs ‚Äî the old **mascot dance** returning to his bones, defiant, joyful.

He **LEAPS**.

Time slows. The **ampoule** burns like a star in his teeth.

**MUSTARD (screaming)**  
KETCH‚Ä¶ UP!

The word **rings** the sky.  
Ketch vanishes into the **vortex**.

A **PINK DETONATION** rolls outward ‚Äî silent, total.  
The Bottle‚Äôs slogans **glitch to nonsense**; tendrils **sugar-crumble**.

The bridge shudders‚Ä¶ and holds.

Silence.

---


### SCENE 22 ‚Äî EXT. THE SOURCE ‚Äî TIMELESS
Weightless pink. Fry boxes orbit; billboard shards drift like quiet asteroids.

At center: the **SOURCE OF SAUCE** ‚Äî an endless, living dip.

The **ampoule** dissolves into it. Ketch floats, fur flecked pink-gold.

The **SAUCE FATHER** manifests ‚Äî a vast, kind hand.

He opens his palm: the **SNOWGLOBE** from Act I, whole again, pink bottle glowing.

**SAUCE FATHER**  
Some things are meant to be shaken, little nugget.

The snowglobe floats to Ketch. He noses it; it **chimes**.

**SAUCE FATHER**  
Well dipped, little nugget.  
Not for pink you leapt today,  
but for choice itself.

**KETCH**  
(soft)  
Did‚Ä¶ we win?

**SAUCE FATHER**  
Reset, you have done.  
The platter begins anew now.  
Sauce invites, not saves.

Ketch nods. Light folds around him.

---

### SCENE 23 ‚Äî EXT. RUINED CITY ‚Äî DAWN
Color seeps back. Beige recedes. Reds, yellows, greens return ‚Äî tentative, then bold.

The **HEINZ BOTTLE** lies shattered. Drones drop like empty cans.

Rebels rise blinking. Mayo bikers laugh in disbelief. Samplers taste the air without dipping. Fry-workers hug with greasy hands.

Mustard claws from rubble, coughing. Scans the horizon.

**MUSTARD (hoarse)**  
‚Ä¶Dog?

Only wind.

A warm **pink mist** curls her paw, then fades.

She swallows. Jaw trembles once. Sets.

**MUSTARD**  
Alright, relic.  
You mattered.

She tosses a single fry into a gutter. The splash sparks the first **ripple of color** returning.

---

### SCENE 24 ‚Äî EXT. NEW WORLD SQUARE ‚Äî DAY
Weeks later.

A plaza built from melted arches and PlayPlace tubes, painted riotously. Children splash in **sauce fountains** (small signs: *DIP KINDLY*). Vendors hawk impossible fries.

At center: a statue of **KETCH**, mid-leap, jaws set, carrying light.

Mustard lingers, chewing a fry she definitely paid for.

**MUSTARD**  
Don‚Äôt get cocky.  
Statues don‚Äôt fetch.  
(beat, muttered)  
Neither do ghosts.

She flicks the last bite into a fountain. Ripples blush pink, settle clear.

A breeze. Faint ‚Äî a **parade drumline** rhythm.  
Mustard almost smiles.

---

## FINAL TAGLINE  
**‚ÄúThe world didn‚Äôt end with a bang.  
It ended with a laugh track.  
And a little pink.‚Äù**
