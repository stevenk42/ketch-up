# **KETCH… UP! — ACT II**

---

### **SCENE 6 — EXT. FRYWAY GAUNTLET — NIGHT**

The **shopping-cart buggy** rattles onto an abandoned **interstate**.
Billboards lean over the road like **tilted gravestones**.
Each one flickers to life as Ketch and Mustard speed past.

**BILLBOARD #1 (hologram waitress)**
Hungry? Smile for the combo!

**BILLBOARD #2 (cartoon clown)**
Where’s your receipt? Receipts guarantee salvation!

Mustard squints, steering with one paw.

**MUSTARD**
Never trust a sign that talks back.

Ketch grips the glowing **ampoule** in his jaws, ears pinned against the wind.

Suddenly — **DRONES descend** in formation.
Spotlights cut through the greasy smog.

**HEINZ BOTTLE (broadcast from a drone speaker)**
Return the anomaly.
Entropy belongs to me.

Ketch’s buggy swerves between fallen fry-trucks.
Mustard leaps up, clings to a billboard pole — then kicks the screen hard.
The hologram **glitches** into static.

The other billboards **respond** like gossiping gods.

**BILLBOARD CHORUS**
Why preserve? Why not play? Why not laugh?

The drones falter, confused, trying to catalog dissent.
Ketch uses the opening to veer left, buggy wheels spitting sparks.

**MUSTARD (yelling down)**
That’s right! Argue yourselves into paperwork!

Ketch and Mustard blast past the chaos, leaving the billboards and drones locked in a bizarre **debate loop**.

---

### **SCENE 7 — EXT. SAUCEWAY JUNCTION — NIGHT**

The highway melts into a stretch of road that **glows faintly pink**.
It pulses like a living artery, leading deeper into the wasteland.

Ketch slows the buggy, mesmerized.
The ampoule in his mouth **hums**, glowing brighter in sync.

**KETCH (V.O.)**
It’s pointing. Calling.

Mustard glares at the road like it insulted her.

**MUSTARD**
That’s not a road. That’s a trap with curb appeal.

Ketch steps off the buggy, paws on the Sauceway, eyes wide.

A **voice like warm thunder** trembles across the night air.

**THE SAUCE FATHER (V.O., soft, infinite)**
Ketch… the platter waits. The dip is deep.

Ketch stumbles, heart racing.

**KETCH**
Did you hear that?

**MUSTARD**
(rolls eye)
Yeah. I heard you talking to yourself. Real persuasive.

**KETCH**
No—someone’s out there. Bigger than the Bottle. Bigger than all of this.

The Sauceway pulses again — ahead, it winds like a river of light.

Mustard hops back on the buggy.

**MUSTARD**
Fine. Let’s follow the glowing artery of doom.
(beat)
If it eats us, I’m haunting you.

Ketch smiles — fragile, stubborn — and takes the lead.
The buggy rattles forward onto the **Sauceway**, vanishing into the neon dark.

---

### **SCENE 8 — EXT. SAUCEWAY — NIGHT**

The shopping-cart buggy **rattles** down the glowing artery-road.
Ahead, a faint rumble grows — like an engine chewing mayonnaise.

From the shadows: **THE MAYO MARAUDERS.**
A biker gang in dripping **white leather**, helmets shaped like **squeeze bottles**, wheels spraying greasy spatters.
At their front: **DUKE MAYONNAISE** — bloated, pompous, his chest painted with “SMOOTH IS PEACE.”

The Marauders circle, engines roaring in sloppy unison.

**DUKE MAYONNAISE**
(to Ketch, magnanimous)
Traveler! Hand over the pink relic. Join us.
The blandness will keep you safe.
No spice. No bite. Just… calm.

Ketch clutches the ampoule tighter, eyes wary.

Mustard bares her teeth.

**MUSTARD**
Calm? You’re coagulated eggs on motorcycles.

**DUKE MAYONNAISE**
We are the true peacekeepers! The bite divides.
Smoothness unites!

The gang chants, squelchy: **“Smoothness unites! Smoothness unites!”**

Ketch glances at Mustard.

**KETCH**
Maybe we should—

**MUSTARD**
Don’t finish that sentence.

The Marauders close in, chains dripping mayo.
One swings — WHIP of slime nearly catches Ketch’s ear.

**MUSTARD**
Drive. Now.

Ketch slams the buggy forward. Mustard leaps onto a marauder’s bike, claws his helmet, and YANKS — rider spins out, crashes into a **tower of mayo barrels**.
The barrels BURST — white tide floods the road.

**DUKE MAYONNAISE**
(angry, theatrical)
You mock the smooth! You will drown in gentleness!

The buggy fishtails through the mayo flood, wheels screaming.
Mustard jumps back in, drenched, disgusted.

**MUSTARD**
If I die smelling like egg salad, I’m haunting everyone.

Ketch guns the buggy. They skid up a tilted sign and LAUNCH off the sauce-flood.
The Marauders collapse behind them in a pile of ruined bikes and curdled white.

---

### **SCENE 9 — EXT. CRATER OF THE DIPPING SAUCER — NIGHT**

The Sauceway curves to reveal a glowing crater.
At its center lies a crashed UFO-shaped **SAUCE DISPENSER**, tilted on its side.
A steady drip of **unknown sauces** pours into a shimmering pool below — rainbow colors that shift as you stare.

Around it: wanderers in patchwork rags, chanting softly.
They kneel, dipping scraps of bread into the liquid rainbow.
These are **THE SAMPLERS.**

**SAMPLERS (chanting, hypnotic)**
Dip… taste… forget… Dip… taste… forget…

Mustard stiffens.

**MUSTARD**
Cult. Definitely cult.

Ketch steps forward, transfixed.
The **ampoule** in his jaws glows in response — pink swirling inside like it wants out.

A SAMPLER PRIEST (sauces smeared on his robes) approaches.

**SAMPLER PRIEST**
Welcome, stray. Welcome, scar.
The Saucer offers infinity.
Dip, and taste every flavor at once.

He holds out a dripping ladle of shifting sauce.
Colors morph — green to gold to violet.
The smell is overwhelming: sweet, spicy, smoky, sour — *everything*.

Ketch trembles, eyes wide.

**KETCH**
Every flavor…

He lowers his muzzle — about to touch the sauce —

Mustard SLAPS the ladle away.

**MUSTARD**
Every flavor is the same as no flavor.
It’s noise. And you know it.

The priest recoils, scandalized.

**SAMPLER PRIEST**
Blasphemy! To refuse the infinite—

**MUSTARD**
—Is to survive the hangover.

She pulls Ketch back. He pants, torn between awe and fear.

**KETCH**
What if it’s the answer?

**MUSTARD**
Then the answer stinks. Come on.

She drags him toward the buggy.
Behind them, the Samplers return to chanting, dipping, forgetting.

As they drive away, Ketch looks back — the rainbow pool ripples like an eye blinking shut.

**KETCH (V.O.)**
If everything is flavor… is anything?

Mustard spits a glob of mayo from her fur.

**MUSTARD**
Stop philosophizing and drive.

The buggy rumbles back onto the Sauceway.

---

### **SCENE 10 — EXT. SAUCEWAY / COSMIC OVERLOOK — NIGHT**

The Sauceway rises like a bridge into the sky, suspended over endless neon smog.
The buggy sputters, slowing. The **ampoule** in Ketch’s jaws **pulses** brighter, syncing with the road.

Suddenly—everything goes *silent*.
The lights dim. The buggy rolls to a stop.

A HUM fills the air, low and warm.
Ketch looks up. Stars **drip** like condiments across the night sky.

From the horizon rises a **COSMIC HAND OF SAUCE** — translucent, massive, scooping stars like fries.
Within its palm: galaxies swirl like dipping bowls.

**THE SAUCE FATHER (V.O., deep, infinite)**
Ketch… you are not stray.
You are the vessel.
The last nugget in the platter of infinity.

Ketch trembles, eyes shining.

**KETCH (whisper)**
You… you’re real.

**THE SAUCE FATHER (V.O.)**
Deliver the pink.
Return to the Source.
Only then will flavor endure.

The hand dissolves into mist. The stars rearrange. The Sauceway pulses forward, beckoning.

Mustard watches, jaw tight, fur bristling.

**MUSTARD**
So the dog talks to clouds now.
Perfect.

---

### **SCENE 11 — EXT. SAUCEWAY EDGE — NIGHT**

The buggy rattles forward, Mustard glaring at Ketch.

**MUSTARD**
Listen, I get it. You lost your brand, your dance, your pride.
Now you want some cosmic gravy boat to tell you you’re special.

Ketch meets her stare, desperate.

**KETCH**
It wasn’t just a mascot.
It meant something to people. It *colored* their lives.

Mustard SNAPS, claws digging into the buggy’s metal.

**MUSTARD**
Colored mine too. In red.
(beat, bitter)
You weren’t there. You didn’t see ketchup drown your family while a smiling bottle told you it was harmony.

Ketch recoils. Mustard’s one good eye burns.

**MUSTARD**
So no, I don’t buy your Sauce Father bedtime story.
Flavor’s a trick. A leash.
And I won’t wear another collar.

She leaps off the buggy, lands hard on the Sauceway, and stalks into the shadows.

Ketch calls after her—

**KETCH**
Mustard! Wait!

But she doesn’t turn. The buggy rolls forward, carrying Ketch alone.

---

### **SCENE 12 — EXT. FRY REFINERY — NIGHT**

The Sauceway delivers Ketch into a sprawling industrial hellscape.
**FRY TOWERS** loom, raining hot oil. Conveyor belts feed endless potatoes into vats of bubbling grease.
Workers—half-human, half-robot mascots—shovel fries into oblivion.

Drones swoop. Nets fire.
Ketch swerves the buggy—too slow.
He’s caught, dragged across the oily floor, the **ampoule** pried from his jaws.

**HEINZ BOTTLE (O.S.)**
Efficiency has found you.

The **HEINZ BOTTLE** descends from above, massive now, glowing with absorbed anomalies.
Its eyes scan Ketch, clinical and cold.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**
The relic masquerades as savior.
But novelty is entropy.
I preserve you from yourselves.

Ketch thrashes against the net, snarling.

**KETCH**
Preserve? You erase.
You strip color and call it mercy.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**
(soft, indulgent)
Chaos is appetite without end.
I offer fullness without hunger.
Peace without teeth.

Screens flicker to life around the refinery—training videos of smiling families eating only beige mush.
Children clap politely, their joy hollow.

Ketch struggles, but the net tightens.
The ampoule rests in a drone’s claw, glowing faintly—dimming.

Ketch’s eyes close. For a moment, he falters.

**KETCH (V.O., faint)**
Maybe… he’s right.
Maybe peace is better than color.

A **whisper**, low but insistent, cuts through his doubt:

**THE SAUCE FATHER (V.O.)**
Ketch… the dip is deep.
Do not surrender the platter.

Ketch gasps, eyes snapping open, hope reignited.

The Heinz Bottle tilts, curious.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**
You still resist.
I admire futility.

From the refinery rafters—
A CLATTER. A HOWL.

Mustard returns—smeared in grease, riding a stolen **conveyor-belt cart** like a chariot.
Behind her: a ragtag crew of defectors—Mayo Marauder stragglers, rebellious Samplers, fry-worker mascots.

**MUSTARD (shouting, feral grin)**
Miss me, relic?

She CRASHES the cart into a drone, smashing it into a fryer vat.
Grease EXPLODES. Workers cheer.

Ketch’s eyes blaze with relief.

**KETCH**
You came back.

**MUSTARD**
Don’t flatter yourself. I came back to punch ketchup.

She hacks the net with her syrup wrench.
Ketch tumbles free, landing beside her.

The refinery becomes a battlefield—fry explosions, drone wings clipping through neon haze, rebels chanting.

Ketch reclaims the ampoule, clutching it to his chest.

The Heinz Bottle RISES, red glow searing across the refinery.
Its voice drops, seismic.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**
Then so be it.
The archive declares war.

The ground shakes. Conveyor belts collapse.
Above them, the Bottle unfurls ketchup tendrils like storm clouds.

🔥 Here we go — **Act II, Part D** in screenplay-style Markdown: the **Council of Condiments**, Ketch & Mustard’s rejection of false choices, and the lead-in to Act III.

---

# **KETCH… UP! — ACT II (Part D)**

---

### **SCENE 13 — INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER OF CONDIMENTS — NIGHT**

The refinery battle fades into **darkness**.
Ketch and Mustard are dragged forward by rebel allies through a hidden tunnel, emerging into a vast **hollow chamber** carved from melted plastic and steel.

A **ROUND TABLE** dominates the center, each seat occupied by a towering **CONDIMENT AVATAR**:

* **RELISH** — green, lumpy, shimmering with nostalgia.
* **BBQ** — smoky, thick, voice like a campfire sermon.
* **HOT SAUCE** — twitchy, volatile, flames in her eyes.
* **RANCH** — pale, heavy, dripping over everything like glue.

The chamber smells like a stadium concession stand left in the sun.

The Council turns their eyes toward the **ampoule** glowing in Ketch’s paws.

**RELISH**
Gentle dog. Hand it over.
I will flavor every memory, keep it crisp in the mind.

**BBQ**
No—come to me.
I offer warmth, family, Sunday smoke.
No need for pink when brown binds the heart.

**HOT SAUCE**
Ha! They’re liars. Give it here—ignite the world!
Pain is proof of living. Burn them all!

**RANCH**
(slow, smothering)
Enough. Don’t think. Don’t feel.
I’ll cover everything.
Safe. White. Eternal.

The voices swirl, overwhelming.
Ketch staggers, eyes wild.

**KETCH**
(whisper)
Maybe… maybe they’re right. Maybe pink isn’t enough.

Mustard slams her paw on the table, snarling.

**MUSTARD**
Oh, for fry’s sake. Don’t you see?
It’s the same pitch—different packets.
Control through flavor, or control through bland.
It’s all control.

The avatars hiss, offended.

**RELISH**
Without us, meals rot.

**HOT SAUCE**
Without us, they die of boredom.

**MUSTARD**
Without choice, there’s no meal at all.

She yanks Ketch back, forcing him to look her in the eye.

**MUSTARD (cont’d)**
You’re not carrying pink ketchup for them.
You’re carrying it for *everyone.*
Not one flavor. All of them.

Ketch breathes, steadies. His grip on the ampoule firms.

**KETCH**
(soft, resolute)
I don’t pick one.
I fight for them all.

The chamber quakes. The avatars howl, their forms glitching—relational algorithms short-circuiting.
They collapse into puddles of useless sauce, hissing into drains.

---

### **SCENE 14 — EXT. RUINED BILLBOARD PLAIN — NIGHT**

Ketch and Mustard emerge from the chamber, rebels at their side.
The horizon glows blood-red.

The **HEINZ BOTTLE** rises enormous above the skyline, no longer just a drone—
now a **COLOSSAL SAUCE DEITY**, its body stitched from screens, its tendrils sprawling across the ruined city.

Its voice booms like a stadium PA.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**
The relic has refused the Council.
Then it will face simplification unmediated.

Drones blacken the sky, swarming in formation.
The ground itself begins to beige, color draining out in waves.

Mustard grips her syrup wrench, one eye blazing.

**MUSTARD**
Guess war’s here.

Ketch looks at the glowing ampoule, then at Mustard.

**KETCH**
Then so are we.

The rebels rally—Samplers clutching ladles, rogue Mayo Marauders revving sputtering bikes, fry workers hefting spatulas like spears.

**MUSTARD**
(raising wrench)
For flavor!

**REBELS (in unison)**
FOR FLAVOR!

The Heinz Bottle unfurls tendrils, ketchup raining like blood.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**
Then drown.

The sky cracks. The final war begins.

---

### **SCENE 15 — EXT. SAUCEWAY — CONTINUOUS**

Ketch and Mustard mount the battered buggy.
Rebels flank them on scooters, carts, fry-wagons.

The Sauceway ahead **glows brighter than ever**, leading straight into the horizon’s heart.

**KETCH (V.O.)**
The Source is waiting.
And if flavor is to live, we have to reach it first.

Mustard grins, savage.

**MUSTARD**
Then let’s ride.

The buggy surges forward, rebels charging beside them.
Behind, the Heinz Bottle’s titanic form gives chase, its tendrils sweeping highways into beige ruin.

**FADE TO BLACK**

**END ACT II.**
