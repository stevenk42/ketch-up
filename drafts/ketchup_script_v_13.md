# ■ KETCH… UP! (Festival Cut v13)
*(Tone: Mad Max meets Toy Story meets The NeverEnding Story, with a dash of Looney Tunes anarchy. Visuals: Akira’s neon apocalypse + Wall-E’s junkyard poetry. Music: Ennio Morricone × Daft Punk × a children’s choir singing the McDonald’s jingle in Latin.)*

## ACT I
### SCENE 1 — EXT. GREASE CANYON — DUSK
The horizon burns with **neon smog**. Mountains of **discarded fry boxes** and **glowing soda cans** jut like monuments.
The wind carries a warped **carnival organ** tune.
A **PINK KETCHUP BOTTLE**, half-buried, catches the last light.

A SHADOW pads into frame:
**KETCH** — scruffy mutt, one floppy ear, eyes heavy with the weight of a ruined brand.
His collar dangles a faded logo: *“PINK KETCHUP — THE FUTURE OF FUN.”*

Ketch noses the bottle, then looks skyward.
**KETCH (V.O.)**
They called me lucky.
Then they changed the label.

He gnaws the cap off like a relic, savoring.
Somewhere in the distance — a **mechanical HUM**.

---
### SCENE 2 — INT. DUMPSTER KINGDOM — NIGHT
(A broken billboard flickers above the kingdom. For a second, the face of the Sauce Father appears in neon static.)
BILLBOARD (glitched, whisper): "Dip deep, little nugget."

Ketch tilts his head. Mustard growls.
**MUSTARD:** "Static. Don’t listen."

Quick flashback: younger Ketch dragging a terrified one-eyed raccoon pup—Mustard—from a burning dumpster. She hisses, but follows him into the smoke.

A **fortress of cardboard** and **Happy Meal toys**, strung with sputtering Christmas lights.
Ketch arranges a **shrine**: cracked snowglobe with a smiling pink bottle trapped inside.
His kingdom is shabby, but cared for.

A RAT scuttles across a fry box. Ketch salutes it like a soldier.

---
### SCENE 3 — EXT. GREASE CANYON SKY — NIGHT
A SWARM OF **HEINZ DRONES** descends. Sleek, black, corporate logos flashing.
The drones’ logos flicker between **Heinz**, **McDonald’s**, and a warped **Burger King crown**.

They carry a crate stamped: **“PINK KETCHUP — LIMITED RUN.”**
At the center floats the **HEINZ BOTTLE DRONE** — a towering bottle-shaped machine, camera-eyes blinking.

Its voice is soft, reverent, cruel — **Werner Herzog corporate void**.
**HEINZ BOTTLE (V.O.)**
Catalog.
Contain.
Conserve.

---
### SCENE 5 — EXT. FRY DUNES — NIGHT
Ketch leaps onto his **shopping-cart buggy**:
— Wheels stitched from roller skates  
— A boom box duct-taped to the front  
— A broomstick steering column  

Above, the Heinz Bottle lowers the crate like an offering.
**HEINZ BOTTLE:** Preservation is mercy. Without mercy, the tongue dies of choice.

Ketch zigzags through nets. A rusted scooter rockets in — **MUSTARD** rides, one eye blazing.
**MUSTARD:** "You buying a ticket, mutt? Or whining at the orchestra?"

Their vehicles collide — chaotic but aligned. Together, they gain speed.

---
### SCENE 6 — EXT. INDUSTRIAL PLATFORM — NIGHT
The Heinz Bottle lands on a platform glowing like a cathedral altar.
ROBOTIC DISCIPLES in tie-dye aprons surround it, humming.

Ketch and Mustard cling to a railing, eyes locked on the crate.
**KETCH (whisper):** "That’s it. The last one."

The crate SEALS click. A faint glow leaks out.
Ketch lunges — jaws clamp on the glowing bulb of pink sauce.

**MUSTARD (shouting):** "You don’t fetch, dog. You reclaim."

They swing together, dangling over the canyon. The Bottle’s voice deepens, hypnotic.
**HEINZ BOTTLE:** "Choose the archive. Be embalmed."

Ketch spits the bulb upward. It arcs through neon night — pink, radiant, impossible.
**MUSTARD (screaming):** "KETCH… UP!"

**SMASH CUT TO:**  
**TITLE CARD:** **KETCH… UP!**

---
## ACT II (Condensed for pacing)
### SCENE 8–11 — THE TRIPLE TEMPTATION GAUNTLET
Instead of three drawn-out temptations, they blur together:
- **Mayo Marauders:** Preaching smooth safety, no risk.  
- **Samplers:** Promising infinite dips, endless noise.  
- **Heinz hologram:** Whispering void, release from choice.  

Action cuts tighter. Banter sharper.
**MUSTARD:** "Less smiling, more biting!"

Ketch nearly succumbs — seeing his old mascot costume, remembered forever. Mustard drags him back.

**MUSTARD:** "Every sauce here wants your leash. Different bottles. Same collar."

---
### SCENE 12 — EXT. COSMIC OVERLOOK — NIGHT
The Sauceway pulses like a living artery. A vast **COSMIC HAND OF SAUCE** scoops galaxies like fries.
**SAUCE FATHER (V.O.):** "Ketch… you are vessel. Deliver the pink. Choice must endure."

Mustard glares.
**MUSTARD:** "If this gravy boat eats us, mutt, I’m haunting you."

---
### SCENE 14 — EXT. FRY REFINERY — NIGHT
Ketch is captured. The Heinz Bottle, massive now, preaches peace without teeth. Screens flicker beige training videos.

Mustard storms back with stolen carts, rebels at her side. **This time, one defector Marauder fights alongside them**, adding depth to the factions.

**MUSTARD:** "Don’t flatter yourself, relic. I came back to punch ketchup."

---
## ACT III
### SCENE 17 — EXT. SAUCEWAY MUSTER — NIGHT
Rebels strap ladles like armor. The Heinz Bottle looms, stitched from billboards.

**MUSTARD (quiet):** "If you jump again, mutt — try not to die about it."

Their charge begins.

---
### SCENE 21 — EXT. THE LEAP — NIGHT
The climax plays much as before: tendrils, the ampoule, the leap. But **stakes are clearer** — the ampoule = *the seed of choice*. Without it, flavor collapses into sameness.

**MUSTARD:** "It matters if we make it matter."

Ketch leaps. Pink detonation. Heinz collapses.

---
### SCENE 23 — EXT. RUINED CITY — DAWN
Color seeps back into the world. Survivors laugh, hug, taste without fear. The defected Marauder removes his helmet, free at last.

Mustard claws from debris, whispers to the absent dog:
**MUSTARD:** "Alright, relic. You mattered."

---
### SCENE 24 — EXT. NEW WORLD SQUARE — DAY
Statue of Ketch mid-leap. Mustard lingers, unimpressed.

**MUSTARD:** "Statues don’t fetch."

She flicks a fry into the fountain. Ripples glow pink.
A faint parade rhythm carries on the breeze. She almost smiles.

---
### (Optional) Post-Credits — OMITTED
The cockroach/taco gag has been cut for tonal balance, preserving emotional resonance.

---
## **FINAL TAGLINE**
**“The world didn’t end with a bang.  
It ended with a laugh track.  
And a little pink.”**
