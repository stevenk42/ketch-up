# **KETCH… UP! — ACT I**

---

### **SCENE 1 — EXT. GREASE CANYON — DUSK**

The horizon burns with **neon smog**. Mountains of **discarded fry boxes** and **glowing soda cans** jut out like monuments.
The wind carries a warped **carnival organ** tune.

A **PINK KETCHUP BOTTLE**, half-buried, catches the light.

A SHADOW pads into frame:
**KETCH** — scruffy mutt, one floppy ear, eyes carrying the weight of a ruined brand.
His collar dangles a faded logo: *“PINK KETCHUP — THE FUTURE OF FUN.”*

Ketch noses the bottle, then looks skyward.

**KETCH (V.O.)**
They called me lucky.
Then they changed the label.

He gnaws the cap off like a relic, savoring.
Somewhere in the distance — a **mechanical HUM**.

---

### **SCENE 2 — INT. DUMPSTER KINGDOM — NIGHT**

A **fortress of cardboard** and **Happy Meal toys**, strung with sputtering Christmas lights.
Ketch arranges a **shrine**: cracked snowglobe with a smiling pink bottle trapped inside.
His kingdom is shabby, but cared for.

A RAT scuttles across a fry box. Ketch salutes it like a soldier.

Suddenly — **INDUSTRIAL ROAR**.
The walls of cardboard tremble. The lights flicker out.

Ketch peers through a crack. His fur bristles.

---

### **SCENE 3 — EXT. GREASE CANYON SKY — NIGHT**

A SWARM OF **HEINZ DRONES** descends. Sleek, black, corporate logos flashing.
They carry a crate stamped: **“PINK KETCHUP — LIMITED RUN.”**

At the center floats the **HEINZ BOTTLE DRONE** — a towering bottle-shaped machine, camera-eyes blinking.
Its voice is soft, reverent, cruel.

**HEINZ BOTTLE (V.O.)**
Catalog.
Contain.
Conserve.

---

### **SCENE 3A — EXT. CANYON RIDGE — CONTINUOUS**

Ketch scrambles from his fort, eyes wide.
The snowglobe falls, cracks, bleeds glitter into the dirt.

He charges toward the light, breath ragged.

---

### **SCENE 3B — EXT. FRY DUNES — NIGHT**

Ketch leaps onto his **shopping-cart buggy**:
— Wheels stitched from roller skates
— A boom box duct-taped to the front
— A broomstick steering column

He shoves. The buggy lurches forward. Sparks trail behind him.

Above, the Heinz Bottle lowers the crate like an offering.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**
Preservation is mercy.

DRONES drop **nets and tethers**.
Ketch zigzags, wheels screeching, fries exploding underfoot.

From the dunes: a RUSTED SCOOTER rockets into view.
Atop it rides **MUSTARD** — one-eyed raccoon, bandana crooked.
Her voice slices the chaos.

**MUSTARD**
You buying a ticket, mutt? Or just whining at the orchestra?

Their vehicles collide — awkward, explosive.
Together, they gain speed.

---

### **SCENE 3C — EXT. INDUSTRIAL PLATFORM — NIGHT**

The Heinz Bottle lands on a platform glowing like a cathedral altar.
ROBOTIC DISCIPLES in tie-dye aprons surround it, humming.

Ketch and Mustard cling to a railing, eyes locked on the crate.

**KETCH (whisper)**
That’s it. The last one.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**
(sermonic)
To keep things palatable is to keep them meaningful.
Democratize flavor… invite chaos.

The crate SEALS click. A faint glow leaks out.

Ketch lunges — jaws clamp on the glowing bulb of pink sauce.
Drones swarm. Mustard claws in beside him.

**MUSTARD (shouting)**
You don’t fetch, dog. You reclaim.

They swing together, dangling over a canyon that yawns with beige static.

The Bottle’s voice deepens.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**
Containment is civilization.

Ketch’s teeth clench. He spits the bulb upward.
It arcs through the neon night — pink, radiant, impossible.

**MUSTARD (screaming)**
KETCH… UP!

**SLOW MOTION:**
The bulb soars. The drones freeze.
The world tilts toward color.

**CUT TO BLACK.**

---

### **SCENE 4 — EXT. SERVICE ROAD TO NOWHERE — NIGHT**

A ribbon of **cracked asphalt** winds through **fry dunes** under a **bruise-purple sky**.
The stolen crate glows on the horizon, borne by distant drones like a funeral procession.

Ketch limps beside the battered **shopping-cart buggy** (wheels wobbling, one front corner melted).
Mustard pushes from behind, muttering, one eye narrowed.

The wind carries a **drive-thru chime**—disembodied, nostalgic.

**KETCH**
(quiet, stubborn)
We keep after them.

**MUSTARD**
We? Bold pronoun for a dog who bites lightbulbs.

Ketch stops, chin up, trying to be taller than destiny.

**KETCH**
It was pink. It was ours. It meant something.

**MUSTARD**
Meaning is a condiment. It goes on top.
(beat)
Still… you leaped. Points for theatrical.

They trudge. The buggy squeals.

**KETCH**
You came back for me.

**MUSTARD**
Don’t flatter yourself. I came for the principle of theft.
(squints ahead)
And because I owe ketchup a scar.

**KETCH**
You hate ketchup?

**MUSTARD**
Hate? No. Hate is hot sauce—bright and temporary.
I have… a philosophy.

Ketch waits. Mustard exhales, conceding to the story’s gravity.

---

### **SCENE 4A — FLASHBACK: EXT. ALLEY OF SUNSET GREASE — YEARS AGO (GOLDEN HOUR)**

Everything is **saturated**, warm, **storybook pretty**.
Small raccoons play in a **pyramid of mustard packets**.
A **SENTIENT MUSTARD BOTTLE**—plushy, choirboy face—preaches from a milk crate pulpit.

**SENTIENT MUSTARD BOTTLE**
Brothers and critters! We are tang. We are truth!
We cut through sweet lies with holy bite!

The raccoon who will become Mustard still has **two eyes**. They shine with belief.

**YOUNG MUSTARD**
(whisper, awed)
We belong.

A figure arrives: a **KETCHUP MASCOT** in immaculate costume (not Ketch), carrying **corporate relief crates**.

**KETCHUP MASCOT**
Behold, cross-brand charity!
May viscosity bind our communities.

Sentient Mustard Bottle smiles too wide.

**SENTIENT MUSTARD BOTTLE**
Blessings! Share the gift.

He tears a seal—the crate **BURSTS**, geysering **red over gold**.
Packets become slick, footing treacherous. Critters slide, scatter.

**YOUNG MUSTARD**
Mama—!

A sheet of ketchup **smothers** the pyramid, drowns the bright yellows.
Young Mustard claws free, one eye seared shut by the acid-sugar burn.
The Mustard Bottle watches—serene, complicit.

**SENTIENT MUSTARD BOTTLE**
(beatifically)
Harmony is sticky.

**BACK TO PRESENT: EXT. SERVICE ROAD — NIGHT**

Mustard touches the scar over his blind eye.

**MUSTARD**
Philosophy: anything that calls itself harmony and needs you not to breathe—
(sardonic)
—might not be harmony.

Ketch swallows; the pink in the far distance pulses like a heartbeat.

**KETCH**
I was a mascot once. We had a dance. “Put it on everything.”
(soft)
They changed the label. The dance stayed in my bones.

Mustard glances at him—some new respect, not yet admitted.

**MUSTARD**
Alright, bones. We follow—
If we’re lucky, we hit them before they pass the arch.

**KETCH**
The arch?

**MUSTARD**
You’ll see.

They angle off the road into a **valley glittering with plastic**.

---

### **SCENE 4B — EXT. GREASE FALLS / DITCH OF TOYS — LATER**

A **waterfall of fry grease** cascades from a broken pipe into a basin of **discarded toys**.
Ketch and Mustard balance across a chain of **sodden foam clowns** like stepping stones.

Ketch slips, catches himself with the broomstick tiller. The tiller **snaps**.

**KETCH**
We’re losing pieces.

**MUSTARD**
Good. Means we’re moving.

They crest the ridge and see it—

---

### **SCENE 5 — EXT. THE CULT OF THE GOLDEN ARCHES — NIGHT**

A **megachurch** built from **fused PlayPlace tubes**, **drive-thru speakers**, and **light-up menu boards**.
At its heart: a **GIANT, GLOWING “M”** that hums like a star.
A congregation of **robed worshippers**—paper-crown miters, fry-box stoles—sways in condiment cadence.

Chants echo: **“BA-DA-BA-BA-BA — WE’RE LOVIN’ IT.”**
Call-and-response: **“BLESSED BE THE VALUE.”** / **“AND ALSO WITH YOU.”**

Ketch and Mustard crouch under a sneeze-guard altar, peering into the nave.

On every wall-mounted **BROKEN DRIVE-THRU SCREEN**, **PROPAGANDA** plays in a jittery loop—
retro corporate training videos melted into singular doctrine.

**SCREEN (V.O., stilted corporate cheer)**
Welcome to Taste Preservation™!
Together, we fight flavor fatigue with responsible curation.

Montage across screens (glitch-art vibes):
— A lab where **bottles sprout camera eyes**.
— A factory line stamping **“PRESERVATION IS MERCY.”**
— A boardroom where a **red silhouette** (the Heinz Bottle’s ancestor) points at a slide: **“ENTROPY = CHOICE.”**
— A faded storyboard panel: **a pink bottle mascot** crossed out with a marker.

**KETCH**
(whisper, stricken)
They erased us.

**MUSTARD**
Of course they did. Erasure is cheaper than apology.

A hush falls over the hall. The congregation turns toward the **pulpit**—
A PRIEST of the Arch, face painted **clown-white** with tear-tracks of barbecue sauce.

**ARCH PRIEST**
Brothers, sisters, and snack-sized: the Council of Condiments conveys a message.

The **SCREENS FLICKER**. Static. Then—

The **HEINZ BOTTLE** fills every screen, larger than doctrine, eyes like winter.

**HEINZ BOTTLE (ON SCREENS)**
Faithful patrons. We near a threshold.

The **GLOWING CRATE** of pink ketchup drifts into frame behind him, suspended by drones as if by seraphs.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**
For too long, novelty has masqueraded as nourishment.
Choice has been marketed as care.
But chaos dilutes meaning.
The tongue may savor variety; the soul requires **continuity**.

Congregation murmurs—rapt, afraid.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**
We will secure the last anomalies.
We will inter them in vaults beneath the Arch, where they may be visited but not consumed.
A museum of temptation, defanged.

**KETCH**
(under breath, breaking)
You can’t… keep taste in a museum.

**MUSTARD**
You can, actually. They’ll call it preservation and sell tickets.

The screens cut to a **TRAINING VIDEO**, young employees in visors repeating:

**EMPLOYEES (IN UNISON)**
If it’s not on the menu, it’s not on the table.

Back to the Heinz Bottle: his tone softens, intimate.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**
Relief will come quickly. The bland will feel like peace.
You will remember fewer colors and be grateful to forget.

Ketch flinches as if struck.

**KETCH**
(to himself)
I remember… pink in a parade.
A kid with sprinkles on her tongue. She asked if flavor could be a friend.

He looks at his battered collar. The faded pink logo. A ghost of a life.

**MUSTARD**
(eyes on Ketch; gentler)
What did you tell her?

**KETCH**
I said yes. And then they changed the label.

The Arch Priest raises a **scepter fashioned from a giant plastic straw**.

**ARCH PRIEST**
Kneel, and be simplified.

The congregation sinks to their knees. A tide of obedience.

Mustard’s fur bristles.

**MUSTARD**
Time to leave. You can’t argue with ritual.

But Ketch is already moving—low, fast—skirting pews of molded plastic.
Mustard curses, follows.

They **slip backstage** through a curtain of bead-strings made from broken sauce packets.

---

### **SCENE 5A — INT. CATHEDRAL BACK CORRIDORS — CONTINUOUS**

A labyrinth of **soft-serve machines**, **discarded menu tiles**, and **locker-room musk**.
They pass a wall of **retired mascots’ heads**—vacant eyes staring.
Ketch’s pace falters at a **PINK MASCOT HEAD** with his brand’s grin—cracked across the smile.

**KETCH**
(hoarse)
I wore that.

**MUSTARD**
Then ditch the ghost. Pick up a wrench.

He plucks a **fountain-syrup wrench** from a utility cart, flips it once, approves the weight.
Hands (paws) Ketch a **grease-slick chain**.

**MUSTARD**
If we’re interrupting a corporate baptism, we do it loud.

They reach a **catwalk** overlooking the nave.

Below: the **crate** is set on an **elevator dais**. Disciples chant in waveform harmony.
The Heinz Bottle’s face fills the central screen—benediction intensifying.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**
A vow now, my faithful:
Repeat—“I renounce the unpredictable.”

**CONGREGATION (in unison)**
I renounce the unpredictable.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**
I embrace the shelf-stable.

**CONGREGATION**
I embrace the shelf-stable.

Mustard rolls his one good eye.

**MUSTARD**
If I had a second eye, I’d roll that too.

Ketch’s paws grip the railing so hard it groans.

**KETCH**
(soft prayer)
Flavor is not a crime.

He leaps from the catwalk—**CLANG**—lands on a lighting rig that **SWINGS** out over the crate.
Mustard groans, follows—less graceful, more angry.

**ARCH PRIEST**
Heretics!

Drones pivot, targeting lasers painting trembling dots across the rig.

**HEINZ BOTTLE (calm, indulgent)**
The relic wishes to reenact his carnival.
Let him.

The rig **BUCKLES**. Ketch dangles above the crate, chain looped around a beam.
He kicks, finds a rhythm—swinging toward the **pink glow** under the crate’s lid.

**MUSTARD**
You sure about this choreography?

**KETCH**
We used to do it for birthdays.

Ketch **drops**—lands in a crouch beside the crate—**CLAP** of paws on steel.
A ripple through the congregation—fear, awe, hunger.

Ketch meets a child’s eyes in the front pew. Paper crown askew. Sauce mustache.
The child whispers, involuntary:

**CHILD**
Pink?

Ketch smiles—small, broken, determined.

**KETCH**
Yeah. Pink.

He jams the **grease chain** under the lid. Strains.
Mustard hammers the latch with the **syrup wrench**.

**MUSTARD**
Hit it where it lies.

The latch **SNAPS**. The lid **SHUDDERS** open a hair.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**
Enough.

A **net-cannon** erupts—webbing the rig, yanking it taut.
The chain slips. Ketch’s paw is **PINNED**.

He winces, teeth bared—but refuses to let go.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**
(soft, almost kind)
Little relic, I am not your enemy.
Entropy is. I hold the line for you.

**KETCH**
Then… why does it feel like you’re pushing me over it?

Silence hangs—heavy, electric.

The Heinz Bottle tilts, considering mercy like a math problem.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**
Because mercy is measured, and you are inefficient.

Mustard, seeing Ketch pinned, does something reckless:
He **turns to the congregation**—spins, brandishes the wrench like a banner.

**MUSTARD**
Hey! Choir! You ever tasted a lie?

He **hurls** the wrench into the **central screen**.
**CRACK**. The Heinz face **GLITCHES**, fractals of red and static.

The chant falters. Someone **gasps**. Someone **laughs**. A tiny, human sound in a room trained out of them.

**KETCH**
Now!

He wrenches the chain—**LID POPS**—a **SPEAR OF PINK LIGHT** slices the nave.
Warm. Ridiculous. Holy.

The congregation reels, faces **rosy** in the glow.

**HEINZ BOTTLE (distorted, angry for the first time)**
Contain it.

Drones dive. Mustard **tackles** one into a font of **sweet-and-sour**; it **sputters**, shorting out.

Ketch plunges his muzzle into the crate—comes up with a **slender, glass ampoule** of the last pink ketchup, cradled in his teeth.

The room **holds its breath**.

The **CHILD** in the paper crown stands on a pew, tiny fist raised.

**CHILD**
KETCH… UP!

The crowd flinches—as if a taboo just got named. Then somewhere: a **chuckle**. Another **whoop**.
Laughter—nervous, then genuine—**spreads**.

The Heinz Bottle’s remaining screens **flare**, voice dropping into the register of storms.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**
You mistake novelty for liberation.
Choice for care.
The palate tires; the public panics; the archive endures.
I am the archive.

Ketch, ampoule between teeth, looks to Mustard.

**KETCH**
(muffled)
Run?

**MUSTARD**
Finally a plan I respect.

They **bolt**—vaulting pews, sliding down a banner of kids’ meal coupons, crashing through a bead-curtain of **sauce packets**.

Drones give chase; the congregation **hesitates**—then, as if remembering their legs belong to them, **parts** to clear a path.

---

### **SCENE 5B — EXT. SIDE EXIT / ALLEY OF HOLY GREASE — CONTINUOUS**

They burst into night air, panting.
The **shopping-cart buggy** waits where they left it, miraculously upright.

**MUSTARD**
Get in, relic.

Ketch hops aboard. Mustard kicks the scooter into the cart’s back brace—**FRANKEN-VEHICLE ENGAGED**.
They rocket down the alley as **drones** erupt from stained-glass windows behind them.

Overhead, the **Heinz Bottle** rises above the Arch like a red moon.

**HEINZ BOTTLE (booming across the city)**
You cannot outrun simplification.

The **ampoule** glows between Ketch’s teeth—warm as memory.

**KETCH (V.O.)**
They called me lucky. Then they changed the label.
But labels peel.

Mustard leans into the wind, one eye on tomorrow.

**MUSTARD**
Okay, dog. You got your miracle.
Now where’s the mountain we die on?

Ketch looks at the horizon—the direction the crate originally traveled.

A faint echo—**a voice like warm thunder**—threads the wind:

**THE SAUCE FATHER (V.O., barely a whisper)**
Ketch… the universe is a dipping platter.

Ketch’s ears twitch. A private awe.

**KETCH**
We take it to the source.

**MUSTARD**
The what now?

**KETCH**
There’s a place where flavors don’t end—
They begin.

Mustard studies him—measuring madness, choosing to believe anyway.

**MUSTARD**
Fine. We chase beginnings.
But if we get there and it’s beige, I’m setting it on fire.

Ketch grins around the ampoule—feral, hopeful.

Behind them, the **Cult of the Golden Arches** roars to life—alarms, sermons, drones fanning out like hornets.

Ahead: the **Grease Canyon** opens into a **cosmic playground** of **interstate overpasses** and **glowing billboards** pointing toward places with names like **THE SAUCEWAY**, **THE ORIGINAL RECIPE**, **EXIT 0**.

The shopping-cart buggy **rattles**, **screams**, **soars** off a busted curb and lands, still somehow intact.

**KETCH (V.O.)**
Flavor is not a crime.

**MUSTARD**
(yelling into the night)
HEY, ARCHIVE!
We choose the unpredictable!

From the Arch spire, the Heinz Bottle answers—cold, infinite:

**HEINZ BOTTLE (O.S.)**
Then I choose to find you.

Ketch and Mustard disappear into the neon.

**SMASH CUT TO:**

**TITLE CARD:** **KETCH… UP!**

**END ACT I.**
