## ACT I

### SCENE 1 ‚Äî EXT. GREASE CANYON ‚Äî DUSK
The horizon burns with **neon smog**. Mountains of **discarded fry boxes** and **glowing soda cans** jut like monuments.  
The wind carries a warped **carnival organ** tune.

A **PINK KETCHUP BOTTLE**, half-buried, catches the last light.  

A SHADOW pads into frame:  
**KETCH** ‚Äî scruffy mutt, one floppy ear, eyes heavy with the weight of a ruined brand.  
His collar dangles a faded logo: *‚ÄúPINK KETCHUP ‚Äî THE FUTURE OF FUN.‚Äù*

Ketch noses the bottle, then looks skyward.  

**KETCH (V.O.)**  
They called me lucky.  
Then they changed the label.  

He gnaws the cap off like a relic, savoring.  
Somewhere in the distance ‚Äî a **mechanical HUM**.  

---

### SCENE 2 ‚Äî INT. DUMPSTER KINGDOM ‚Äî NIGHT
A **fortress of cardboard** and **Happy Meal toys**, strung with sputtering Christmas lights.  
Ketch arranges a **shrine**: cracked snowglobe with a smiling pink bottle trapped inside.  
His kingdom is shabby, but cared for.  

A RAT scuttles across a fry box. Ketch salutes it like a soldier.  

Suddenly ‚Äî **INDUSTRIAL ROAR**.  
The walls of cardboard tremble. The lights flicker out.  

Ketch peers through a crack. His fur bristles.  

---

### SCENE 3 ‚Äî EXT. GREASE CANYON SKY ‚Äî NIGHT
A SWARM OF **HEINZ DRONES** descends. Sleek, black, corporate logos flashing.  
They carry a crate stamped: **‚ÄúPINK KETCHUP ‚Äî LIMITED RUN.‚Äù**  

At the center floats the **HEINZ BOTTLE DRONE** ‚Äî a towering bottle-shaped machine, camera-eyes blinking.  
Its voice is soft, reverent, cruel ‚Äî **Werner Herzog corporate void**.  

**HEINZ BOTTLE (V.O.)**  
Catalog.  
Contain.  
Conserve.  

---

### SCENE 4 ‚Äî EXT. CANYON RIDGE ‚Äî CONTINUOUS
Ketch scrambles from his fort, eyes wide.  
The snowglobe falls, cracks, bleeds glitter into the dirt.  

He charges toward the light, breath ragged.  

---

### SCENE 5 ‚Äî EXT. FRY DUNES ‚Äî NIGHT
Ketch leaps onto his **shopping-cart buggy**:  
‚Äî Wheels stitched from roller skates  
‚Äî A boom box duct-taped to the front  
‚Äî A broomstick steering column  

He shoves. The buggy lurches forward. Sparks trail behind him.  

Above, the Heinz Bottle lowers the crate like an offering.  

**HEINZ BOTTLE**  
Preservation is mercy.  
Without mercy, the tongue dies of choice.  

DRONES drop **nets and tethers**.  
Ketch zigzags, wheels screeching, fries exploding underfoot.  

From the dunes: a RUSTED SCOOTER rockets into view.  
Atop it rides **MUSTARD** ‚Äî one-eyed raccoon, bandana crooked.  
Her voice slices the chaos.  

**MUSTARD**  
You buying a ticket, mutt? Or just whining at the orchestra?  

Their vehicles collide ‚Äî awkward, explosive.  
Together, they gain speed.  

---

### SCENE 6 ‚Äî EXT. INDUSTRIAL PLATFORM ‚Äî NIGHT
The Heinz Bottle lands on a platform glowing like a cathedral altar.  
ROBOTIC DISCIPLES in tie-dye aprons surround it, humming.  

Ketch and Mustard cling to a railing, eyes locked on the crate.  

**KETCH (whisper)**  
That‚Äôs it. The last one.  

**HEINZ BOTTLE**  
To keep things palatable is to keep them meaningful.  
Democratize flavor‚Ä¶ invite chaos.  

The crate SEALS click. A faint glow leaks out.  

Ketch lunges ‚Äî jaws clamp on the glowing bulb of pink sauce.  
Drones swarm. Mustard claws in beside him.  

**MUSTARD (shouting)**  
You don‚Äôt fetch, dog. You reclaim.  

They swing together, dangling over a canyon that yawns with beige static.  

The Bottle‚Äôs voice deepens, hypnotic.  

**HEINZ BOTTLE**  
Little relic, pink curdles.  
But beige endures.  
Choose immortality.  

Ketch‚Äôs teeth clench. He spits the bulb upward.  
It arcs through the neon night ‚Äî pink, radiant, impossible.  

**MUSTARD (screaming)**  
KETCH‚Ä¶ UP!  

**SMASH CUT TO:**  
**TITLE CARD:** **KETCH‚Ä¶ UP!**  

**CUT TO BLACK.**  

---

### SCENE 7 ‚Äî EXT. SERVICE ROAD TO NOWHERE ‚Äî NIGHT
The buggy rattles along a broken road.  
Ketch limps beside it, Mustard pushing.  

**MUSTARD**  
That stunt? Real cute. Almost heroic.  
(beat, softer)  
Don‚Äôt make a habit of it.  

Ketch glances at her, surprised by the edge of care in her tone.  

They walk into the neon dark.
