## ACT I

### SCENE 1 ‚Äî EXT. GREASE CANYON ‚Äî DUSK
The horizon burns with **neon smog**. Mountains of **discarded fry boxes** and **glowing soda cans** jut like monuments.  
The wind carries a warped **carnival organ** tune.

A **PINK KETCHUP BOTTLE**, half-buried, catches the last light.  

A SHADOW pads into frame:  
**KETCH** ‚Äî scruffy mutt, one floppy ear, eyes heavy with the weight of a ruined brand.  
His collar dangles a faded logo: *‚ÄúPINK KETCHUP ‚Äî THE FUTURE OF FUN.‚Äù*

Ketch noses the bottle, then looks skyward.  

**KETCH (V.O.)**  
They called me lucky.  
Then they changed the label.  

He gnaws the cap off like a relic, savoring.  
Somewhere in the distance ‚Äî a **mechanical HUM**.  

---

### SCENE 2 ‚Äî INT. DUMPSTER KINGDOM ‚Äî NIGHT
A **fortress of cardboard** and **Happy Meal toys**, strung with sputtering Christmas lights.  
Ketch arranges a **shrine**: cracked snowglobe with a smiling pink bottle trapped inside.  
His kingdom is shabby, but cared for.  

A RAT scuttles across a fry box. Ketch salutes it like a soldier.  

Suddenly ‚Äî **INDUSTRIAL ROAR**.  
The walls of cardboard tremble. The lights flicker out.  

Ketch peers through a crack. His fur bristles.  

---

### SCENE 3 ‚Äî EXT. GREASE CANYON SKY ‚Äî NIGHT
A SWARM OF **HEINZ DRONES** descends. Sleek, black, corporate logos flashing.  
They carry a crate stamped: **‚ÄúPINK KETCHUP ‚Äî LIMITED RUN.‚Äù**  

At the center floats the **HEINZ BOTTLE DRONE** ‚Äî a towering bottle-shaped machine, camera-eyes blinking.  
Its voice is soft, reverent, cruel ‚Äî **Werner Herzog corporate void**.  

**HEINZ BOTTLE (V.O.)**  
Catalog.  
Contain.  
Conserve.  

---

### SCENE 4 ‚Äî EXT. CANYON RIDGE ‚Äî CONTINUOUS
Ketch scrambles from his fort, eyes wide.  
The snowglobe falls, cracks, bleeds glitter into the dirt.  

He charges toward the light, breath ragged.  

---

### SCENE 5 ‚Äî EXT. FRY DUNES ‚Äî NIGHT
Ketch leaps onto his **shopping-cart buggy**:  
‚Äî Wheels stitched from roller skates  
‚Äî A boom box duct-taped to the front  
‚Äî A broomstick steering column  

He shoves. The buggy lurches forward. Sparks trail behind him.  

Above, the Heinz Bottle lowers the crate like an offering.  

**HEINZ BOTTLE**  
Preservation is mercy.  
Without mercy, the tongue dies of choice.  

DRONES drop **nets and tethers**.  
Ketch zigzags, wheels screeching, fries exploding underfoot.  

From the dunes: a RUSTED SCOOTER rockets into view.  
Atop it rides **MUSTARD** ‚Äî one-eyed raccoon, bandana crooked.  
Her voice slices the chaos.  

**MUSTARD**  
You buying a ticket, mutt? Or just whining at the orchestra?  

Their vehicles collide ‚Äî awkward, explosive.  
Together, they gain speed.  

---

### SCENE 6 ‚Äî EXT. INDUSTRIAL PLATFORM ‚Äî NIGHT
The Heinz Bottle lands on a platform glowing like a cathedral altar.  
ROBOTIC DISCIPLES in tie-dye aprons surround it, humming.  

Ketch and Mustard cling to a railing, eyes locked on the crate.  

**KETCH (whisper)**  
That‚Äôs it. The last one.  

**HEINZ BOTTLE**  
To keep things palatable is to keep them meaningful.  
Democratize flavor‚Ä¶ invite chaos.  

The crate SEALS click. A faint glow leaks out.  

Ketch lunges ‚Äî jaws clamp on the glowing bulb of pink sauce.  
Drones swarm. Mustard claws in beside him.  

**MUSTARD (shouting)**  
You don‚Äôt fetch, dog. You reclaim.  

They swing together, dangling over a canyon that yawns with beige static.  

The Bottle‚Äôs voice deepens, hypnotic.  

**HEINZ BOTTLE**  
Little relic, pink curdles.  
But beige endures.  
Choose immortality.  

Ketch‚Äôs teeth clench. He spits the bulb upward.  
It arcs through the neon night ‚Äî pink, radiant, impossible.  

**MUSTARD (screaming)**  
KETCH‚Ä¶ UP!  

**SMASH CUT TO:**  
**TITLE CARD:** **KETCH‚Ä¶ UP!**  

**CUT TO BLACK.**  

---

### SCENE 7 ‚Äî EXT. SERVICE ROAD TO NOWHERE ‚Äî NIGHT
The buggy rattles along a broken road.  
Ketch limps beside it, Mustard pushing.  

**MUSTARD**  
That stunt? Real cute. Almost heroic.  
(beat, softer)  
Don‚Äôt make a habit of it.  

Ketch glances at her, surprised by the edge of care in her tone.  

They walk into the neon dark.

**END OF ACT I**

## ACT II

### SCENE 8 ‚Äî EXT. FRYWAY GAUNTLET ‚Äî NIGHT
The **shopping-cart buggy** rattles onto an abandoned **interstate**.  
Billboards lean over the road like **tilted gravestones**.  
Each one flickers to life as Ketch and Mustard speed past.

**BILLBOARD #1 (hologram waitress)**  
Hungry? Smile for the combo!  

**BILLBOARD #2 (cartoon clown)**  
Where‚Äôs your receipt? Receipts guarantee salvation!  

Mustard squints, steering with one paw.  

**MUSTARD**  
Never trust a sign that talks back.  

Ketch grips the glowing **ampoule** in his jaws, ears pinned against the wind.  

Suddenly ‚Äî **DRONES descend** in formation.  
Spotlights cut through greasy smog.  

**HEINZ BOTTLE (broadcast, void-like)**  
Return the anomaly.  
Tonight the tongue forgets color.  
Tomorrow it thanks me for forgetting.  

Ketch swerves between fallen fry-trucks.  
Mustard leaps up, clings to a billboard pole, then kicks the screen hard.  
The hologram **glitches** into static.  

The other billboards **respond**, gossiping like gods.  

**BILLBOARD CHORUS**  
Why preserve? Why not play? Why not laugh?  

The drones falter, trying to catalog dissent.  
Ketch uses the opening to veer left, buggy wheels spitting sparks.  

**MUSTARD (yelling down)**  
That‚Äôs right! Argue yourselves into paperwork!  

They blast past the chaos, leaving drones locked in a **debate loop**.  

---

### SCENE 9 ‚Äî EXT. SAUCEWAY JUNCTION ‚Äî NIGHT
The highway melts into a stretch of road that **glows faintly pink**.  
It pulses like a living artery, leading deeper into wasteland.  

Ketch slows the buggy, mesmerized.  
The ampoule in his mouth **hums**, glowing brighter in sync.  

**KETCH (V.O.)**  
It‚Äôs pointing. Calling.  

Mustard glares at the road like it insulted her.  

**MUSTARD**  
That‚Äôs not a road. That‚Äôs a trap with curb appeal.  

Ketch steps off the buggy, paws on the Sauceway, eyes wide.  

A **voice like warm thunder** trembles across the night air.  

**SAUCE FATHER (V.O., infinite)**  
Ketch‚Ä¶ the platter waits.  
The dip is deep.  

Ketch stumbles, heart racing.  

**KETCH**  
Did you hear that?  

**MUSTARD**  
Yeah. I heard you talking to yourself. Real persuasive.  

**KETCH**  
No‚Äîsomeone‚Äôs out there. Bigger than the Bottle.  

The Sauceway pulses again ‚Äî ahead, it winds like a river of light.  

Mustard hops back on the buggy.  

**MUSTARD**  
Fine. Let‚Äôs follow the glowing artery of doom.  
(beat, softer)  
But if it eats us, mutt‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm haunting you.  

Ketch smiles ‚Äî fragile, stubborn ‚Äî and takes the lead.  

---

### SCENE 10 ‚Äî EXT. SAUCEWAY ‚Äî LATER
Engines roar. **THE MAYO MARAUDERS** crest a hill.  
A biker gang in dripping **white leather**, helmets shaped like squeeze bottles.  
Their wheels spray greasy spatters.  

At their front: **DUKE MAYONNAISE** ‚Äî bloated, pompous, chest painted with ‚ÄúSMOOTH IS PEACE.‚Äù  

The gang encircles, engines idling wetly.  

**DUKE MAYONNAISE**  
Hand over the pink relic. Join us.  
The blandness will keep you safe.  
No spice. No bite. Just‚Ä¶ calm.  

Mustard sneers.  

**MUSTARD**  
Calm? You‚Äôre coagulated eggs on motorcycles.  

**DUKE MAYONNAISE**  
We are the true peacekeepers! The bite divides.  
Smoothness unites!  

The gang chants, squelchy: **‚ÄúSmoothness unites! Smoothness unites!‚Äù**  

Ketch looks between them, uncertain.  

**KETCH**  
Maybe we should‚Äî  

**MUSTARD**  
Don‚Äôt finish that sentence.  

A whip of mayo nearly slaps Ketch‚Äôs ear.  
The buggy fishtails through goo.  

Mustard leaps onto a marauder‚Äôs bike, claws his helmet, and YANKS ‚Äî the rider spins out, crashes into a **tower of mayo barrels**.  
The barrels BURST ‚Äî a flood of white goo.  

**DUKE MAYONNAISE (roaring)**  
You will drown in gentleness!  

Ketch guns the buggy, wheels screaming.  
Mustard jumps back in, dripping, gagging.  

**MUSTARD**  
If I die smelling like egg salad, mutt‚Äî  
I‚Äôm haunting everyone.  

They skid up a tilted sign and **LAUNCH** clear, leaving the Marauders behind in a curdled pile.  

---

### SCENE 11 ‚Äî EXT. CRATER OF THE DIPPING SAUCER ‚Äî NIGHT
The Sauceway curves to a crater glowing with **rainbow sauce light**.  
At its center lies a crashed UFO-shaped **SAUCE DISPENSER**, dripping unknown condiments into a shimmering pool.  

Wanderers kneel, dipping scraps of bread.  
These are **THE SAMPLERS.**  

**SAMPLERS (chanting, hypnotic)**  
Dip‚Ä¶ taste‚Ä¶ forget‚Ä¶  
Dip‚Ä¶ taste‚Ä¶ forget‚Ä¶  

Mustard stiffens.  

**MUSTARD**  
Cult. Definitely cult.  

The **ampoule** glows, pink swirling furiously.  
A PRIEST approaches, sauce smeared on his robes.  

**SAMPLER PRIEST**  
Welcome, stray. Welcome, scar.  
The Saucer offers infinity.  
Dip once‚Ä¶ and you‚Äôll never stop dipping.  
That‚Äôs the gift.  

He holds out a dripping ladle.  
Ketch trembles, transfixed.  

**KETCH**  
Every flavor‚Ä¶  

He lowers his muzzle ‚Äî about to touch ‚Äî  

Mustard SLAPS the ladle away.  

**MUSTARD**  
Every flavor is the same as no flavor.  
It‚Äôs noise. And you know it.  

The priest recoils, scandalized.  

**SAMPLER PRIEST**  
Blasphemy! To refuse the infinite‚Äî  

**MUSTARD**  
‚ÄîIs to survive the hangover.  

She drags Ketch back. He pants, torn between awe and fear.  

**KETCH**  
What if it‚Äôs the answer?  

**MUSTARD**  
Then the answer stinks.  

They retreat. Behind them, Samplers return to chanting.  
The rainbow pool ripples like an eye blinking shut.  

**KETCH (V.O.)**  
If everything is flavor‚Ä¶ is anything?  

Mustard spits out a glob of mayo.  

**MUSTARD**  
Stop philosophizing and drive.  

---

### SCENE 12 ‚Äî EXT. SAUCEWAY / COSMIC OVERLOOK ‚Äî NIGHT
The Sauceway rises into sky.  
The buggy sputters, slows. The **ampoule** pulses wildly.  

Suddenly‚Äîeverything goes silent.  

Stars drip like condiments across the night.  
From the horizon rises a **COSMIC HAND OF SAUCE**, scooping galaxies like fries.  

**SAUCE FATHER (V.O.)**  
Ketch‚Ä¶ you are not stray.  
You are the vessel.  
The last nugget in the platter of infinity.  

Ketch trembles.  

**KETCH**  
You‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre real.  

**SAUCE FATHER (V.O.)**  
Deliver the pink.  
Return to the Source.  
Only then will flavor endure.  

Mustard watches, jaw tight.  

**MUSTARD**  
So the dog talks to clouds now.  
Perfect.  

---

### SCENE 13 ‚Äî EXT. SAUCEWAY EDGE ‚Äî NIGHT
The buggy rattles forward.  
Mustard‚Äôs temper finally snaps.  

**MUSTARD**  
You lost your brand, your dance, your pride.  
Now you want some cosmic gravy boat to tell you you‚Äôre special.  

**KETCH**  
It wasn‚Äôt just a mascot.  
It meant something. It colored lives.  

**MUSTARD**  
Colored mine too. In red.  
Ketchup drowned my family while a smiling bottle told me it was harmony.  

Ketch recoils. Mustard‚Äôs eye burns.  

**MUSTARD**  
So no. I don‚Äôt buy your Sauce Father bedtime story.  
Flavor‚Äôs a leash.  
And I won‚Äôt wear another collar.  

She leaps off the buggy, stalks into shadow.  
Ketch calls after her‚Äî  

**KETCH**  
Mustard! Wait!  

No answer.  

---

### SCENE 14 ‚Äî EXT. FRY REFINERY ‚Äî NIGHT
The Sauceway delivers Ketch into a sprawling industrial hellscape.  
**FRY TOWERS** rain hot oil. Mascot-workers shovel endlessly.  

Drones swoop. Nets fire.  
Ketch is caught, dragged. The **ampoule** pried from his jaws.  

**HEINZ BOTTLE (descending)**  
Efficiency has found you.  

The Bottle is massive now, glowing with absorbed anomalies.  

**HEINZ BOTTLE**  
Chaos is appetite without end.  
I offer fullness without hunger.  
Peace without teeth.  

Screens flicker training videos of smiling families eating beige mush.  

Ketch falters.  

**KETCH (V.O., faint)**  
Maybe‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs right.  

The **SAUCE FATHER** whispers through static:  

**SAUCE FATHER (V.O.)**  
Do not surrender the platter.  

Ketch gasps, hope reignited.  

From the rafters‚Äî  
A HOWL.  

Mustard returns, riding a stolen **conveyor cart**, rebels at her back.  

**MUSTARD**  
Miss me, relic?  

She crashes into drones, grease exploding.  
Cuts Ketch free.  

**KETCH**  
You came back.  

**MUSTARD**  
Don‚Äôt flatter yourself. I came back to punch ketchup.  

The Heinz Bottle RISES, titanic.  

**HEINZ BOTTLE**  
Then so be it.  
The archive declares war.  

The ground shakes. Tendrils unfurl.  
The final conflict begins.  

---

### SCENE 15 ‚Äî INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER OF CONDIMENTS ‚Äî NIGHT
Hidden within refinery ruins: a **round table of avatars**.  
Relish, BBQ, Hot Sauce, Ranch ‚Äî each towering, grotesque.  

They tempt:  
- **RELISH**: *‚ÄúI‚Äôll preserve memory crisp.‚Äù*  
- **BBQ**: *‚ÄúI bind the heart in smoke.‚Äù*  
- **HOT SAUCE**: *‚ÄúBurn, and prove you live.‚Äù*  
- **RANCH**: *‚ÄúI‚Äôll smother everything. Safe. White. Eternal.‚Äù*  

Ketch staggers, overwhelmed.  

**KETCH**  
Maybe pink isn‚Äôt enough.  

Mustard slams her paw.  

**MUSTARD**  
Every one of them wants your leash.  
Different sauces. Same collar.  

She yanks him back.  

**MUSTARD (cont‚Äôd)**  
You‚Äôre not carrying pink for them.  
You‚Äôre carrying it for everyone.  

Ketch steadies.  

**KETCH**  
I don‚Äôt pick one.  
I fight for them all.  

The avatars glitch, collapse into puddles.  

---

### SCENE 16 ‚Äî EXT. BILLBOARD PLAIN ‚Äî NIGHT
The Heinz Bottle looms enormous, blotting the horizon.  
Tendrils sweep, draining color.  

Rebels rally, spatulas raised.  

**MUSTARD**  
For flavor!  

**REBELS**  
FOR FLAVOR!  

The Heinz Bottle unfurls, ketchup raining like blood.  

**HEINZ BOTTLE**  
Then drown.  

The sky cracks.  
The final war begins.  

**FADE TO BLACK.**  

---

**END OF ACT II**  

---

## ACT III

### SCENE 17 ‚Äî EXT. SAUCEWAY MUSTER ‚Äî NIGHT
**FADE IN:**

A battlefield of carts, scooters, and fry-wagons idling under a bruised sky.  
Rebels strap on spatulas and ladles like armor. The **SAUCEWAY** ahead glows ‚Äî a runway to fate.

Ketch tightens the ragged strap of his collar. Mustard checks her bent **syrup wrench**.

**MUSTARD**  
(quiet, not looking at him)  
If you jump again, try not to die about it.

Ketch almost smiles.

**KETCH**  
I‚Äôll‚Ä¶ dance around the dying part.

She snorts ‚Äî a micro-laugh she won‚Äôt admit.

A shadow spreads across them. They look up.

The **HEINZ BOTTLE** rises colossal, body stitched from flickering billboards, ketchup-tendrils uncoiling like storm fronts.

**HEINZ BOTTLE (booming, void-calm)**  
Tonight the tongue forgets color.  
Tomorrow it thanks me for forgetting.

Engines growl. Ketch nods to Mustard. She nods back.

**KETCH**  
We ride through.

They kick off ‚Äî the charge begins.

---

### SCENE 18 ‚Äî EXT. SAUCEWAY / WAR OF FLAVORS ‚Äî NIGHT
Chaos in neon:  
‚Äî **Mayo Marauders** fling explosive jars; white bursts against red tendrils.  
‚Äî **Samplers** hurl rainbow ladles that hiss through drone armor.  
‚Äî **Fry-workers** catapult baskets of molten fries like meteor showers.

The Heinz Bottle‚Äôs tendrils sweep highways into beige. Color drains in **waves**.

Ketch steers the shopping-cart buggy through collapsing billboards. Mustard stands braced, wrench a metronome of violence.

**MUSTARD**  
(to rebels)  
Drones first! Don‚Äôt sermonize the skyline!

**HEINZ BOTTLE**  
Relic. Surrender novelty.  
Be archived. Be safe.

A tendril lashes down, snaring the buggy‚Äôs tail. Ketch veers into a falling sign ‚Äî **SMASH** ‚Äî severing the tendril.

Mustard glances at Ketch, impressed despite herself.

**MUSTARD**  
Okay, bones. That was almost poetry.

They crest a ridge ‚Äî and see it:

Far ahead, a pulsing **VORTEX OF LIGHT**: the **SOURCE OF SAUCE**.  
It beats like a heart, pink radiance leaking through reality‚Äôs seams.

---

### SCENE 19 ‚Äî EXT. ASCENT TO THE SOURCE ‚Äî CONTINUOUS
The Sauceway narrows into a **spiral bridge of light** climbing into the vortex.  
The buggy rattles onto it. Bolts scream. The world drops away beneath them.

The Heinz Bottle hauls itself up the spiral like a living skyscraper.  
Screens across its body flicker propaganda, then stillness ‚Äî only its eyes remain, winter-cold.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**  
Pink fades.  
Beige endures.

Rebel engines falter; few can follow this high. The fight thins to **Ketch and Mustard** alone.

Mustard steels herself, then ‚Äî softer:

**MUSTARD**  
Hey. If you leap‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll be the one yelling.

Ketch clutches the **ampoule**. It flares, almost blinding.

**KETCH**  
Then I‚Äôll leap toward the sound.

---

### SCENE 20 ‚Äî EXT. BRIDGE TO THE SOURCE ‚Äî CONTINUOUS
A tendril slams across the bridge, blocking the path.  
The buggy skids sideways. Sparks arc into the void.

Ketch and Mustard scramble off, paws and claws scrambling for purchase.

The Heinz Bottle lowers its massive face. The billboards that make its skin go black, swallowing their reflections.

**HEINZ BOTTLE (near-whisper, everywhere)**  
Be remembered.  
Not lived.

Ketch stares into the vortex, breath ragged.

**KETCH**  
Tell me it matters.

Mustard‚Äôs one good eye shines, naked, unguarded.

**MUSTARD**  
It matters if we make it matter.

Ketch nods ‚Äî a vow.

---

### SCENE 21 ‚Äî EXT. THE LEAP ‚Äî NIGHT
Tendrils **lash**, wrapping Ketch‚Äôs chest and legs, dragging him backward.  
He refuses to drop the **ampoule** ‚Äî jaw clenched, veins standing in his neck.

**HEINZ BOTTLE (rising, thunder)**  
Choose immortality.

Mustard **hurls herself** at the tendrils, wrench smashing, claws tearing.  
A tendril snaps ‚Äî red spray hisses into the star-dark.

For a heartbeat, Ketch is free.

A low hum swells ‚Äî the **SAUCE FATHER** in the wind.

**SAUCE FATHER (V.O., warm thunder)**  
Leap, child.  
The platter is waiting.

Ketch runs.  
He runs like a mascot on parade, the old **dance** returning to his bones ‚Äî a final, defiant flourish.

He **LEAPS**.

Time **slows**.  
The **ampoule** burns like a star clenched in his teeth.  
Mustard reaches after him, voice tearing the sky:

**MUSTARD (screaming)**  
KETCH‚Ä¶ UP!

The word resonates ‚Äî fractures the clouds ‚Äî rings like a bell.

Ketch vanishes into the **vortex**.

A **PINK DETONATION** rolls outward ‚Äî silent, total.  
The Heinz Bottle‚Äôs slogans **glitch to nonsense**; its tendrils wither, crumble like sugar glass.

The spiral bridge shudders‚Ä¶ then holds.

Silence.

---

### SCENE 22 ‚Äî EXT. THE SOURCE ‚Äî TIMELESS
Weightless pink light.  
Fry boxes orbit like moons; fragments of billboards drift like quiet asteroids.

At the center: the **SOURCE OF SAUCE** ‚Äî an endless dip, all colors alive inside it.

Ketch floats, the **ampoule** dissolved into the Source.  
His fur gleams, stained-glass flecks of pink and gold.

The **SAUCE FATHER** manifests ‚Äî a vast, kind hand of sauce tendrils.

**SAUCE FATHER**  
Well dipped, little nugget.  
You leapt not for pink,  
but for choice itself.

**KETCH**  
(soft)  
Did‚Ä¶ we win?

**SAUCE FATHER**  
You reset.  
The platter begins anew.  
Remember ‚Äî  
sauce is invitation, not salvation.

Ketch nods, eyes closing as light folds around him.

---

### SCENE 23 ‚Äî EXT. RUINED CITY ‚Äî DAWN
Color seeps back into the world.  
Beige recedes. Reds, yellows, greens return ‚Äî tentative, then bold.

The **HEINZ BOTTLE** lies shattered, a husk of dead screens and dry glass.  
Drones fall like empty cans.

Rebels rise from rubble, blinking in pink morning.  
Mayo bikers lift helmets, laugh in disbelief.  
Samplers touch their tongues and laugh without dipping.  
Fry-workers hug with greasy hands.

Mustard claws out of debris, coughing.  
She scans the horizon.

**MUSTARD**  
(hoarse)  
‚Ä¶Dog?

Only wind.

A warm **pink mist** curls around her paw, then fades.

She swallows, jaw trembling once ‚Äî then sets it.

**MUSTARD**  
Alright, relic.  
You mattered.

---

### SCENE 24 ‚Äî EXT. NEW WORLD SQUARE ‚Äî DAY
Weeks later.

A plaza rebuilt from melted arches and PlayPlace tubes, painted in riotous color.  
Children splash in **sauce fountains** (small signs: *DIP KINDLY*). Vendors hawk impossible fries.

At the center, a statue:  
**KETCH**, mid-leap, jaws set, forever carrying light.

Mustard lingers at the edge, chewing a fry she definitely paid for.  
She eyes the statue, unimpressed on purpose.

**MUSTARD**  
Don‚Äôt get cocky.  
Statues don‚Äôt fetch.

She flicks the last bite into a fountain.  
Ripples glow pink, then settle to clear.

A breeze passes. Somewhere, faint ‚Äî a **parade drumline** rhythm.  
Mustard almost smiles.

---

### SCENE 25 ‚Äî POST-CREDITS ‚Äî EXT. EMPTY LOT ‚Äî NIGHT
Silence.  
An abandoned slab of asphalt under a humming sign.

A **cockroach** ambles to a tiny **puddle of pink** left in a crack.  
It dips a crumb. Tastes.  
Nods, solemn, satisfied.

Darkness thickens. From nowhere:

**SFX: A single DRIVE-THRU CHIME.**

**CUT TO BLACK.**

**TEXT:** *‚ÄúTHE END. (OR IS IT?)‚Äù*

---

## **FINAL TAGLINE**  
**‚ÄúThe world didn‚Äôt end with a bang.  
It ended with a laugh track.  
And a little pink.‚Äù**
