## ACT I

### SCENE 1 — EXT. GREASE CANYON — DUSK
Neon smog boils over mountains of **discarded fry boxes** and **glowing soda cans**.  
A warped **carnival organ** wheezes somewhere unseen.

A **PINK KETCHUP BOTTLE**, half-buried, catches dying light.

A SHADOW pads in: **KETCH** — scruffy mutt, one floppy ear, collar tag: *“PINK KETCHUP — THE FUTURE OF FUN.”*

Ketch noses the bottle. Looks skyward.

**KETCH (V.O.)**  
They called me lucky.  
(beat)  
Then they changed the label.

He gnaws the cap, savoring like a relic—  
A distant **MECHANICAL HUM** cuts the moment in half.  
The HUM carries the faint **smell of burnt sugar**, acrid and wrong.  
Ketch’s ears flick back. His jaw tightens. He feels it before he understands it.

---

### SCENE 2 — INT. DUMPSTER KINGDOM — NIGHT
A **cardboard fortress** and **Happy Meal toy** battlements under sputtering Christmas lights.  
At its heart: a cracked **snowglobe**, pink bottle trapped inside — centerpiece of a **shrine**.

A broken billboard flickers above. Neon static forms a face.

**BILLBOARD (glitched, whisper)**  
Dip deep, little nugget.

Ketch tilts his head. Mustard growls from the shadows: **MUSTARD**, one-eyed raccoon, bandana crooked.

**MUSTARD**  
Static. Don’t listen.

(FLASH: Younger Ketch dragging a terrified raccoon pup — one eye shut — from a burning dumpster.  
The hiss of smoke. Her claws clutch him anyway. Two survivors.)

Ketch arranges the snowglobe in the shrine. Around it: busted toys, cracked fry cups, half-broken lights. Shabby, but cared for.

A RAT scuttles across a fry box. Ketch salutes it like a soldier.  
A moment of absurd honor in the ruin.

**INDUSTRIAL ROAR.** The walls tremble. Lights die.

Ketch peers through a crack, fur bristling.

---

### SCENE 3 — EXT. GREASE CANYON SKY — NIGHT
A swarm of **HEINZ DRONES** descends — sleek, black.  
Logos flicker: **Heinz**, **McDonald’s**, and a third sigil: a **melted crown**, unreadable.

They ferry a crate: **“PINK KETCHUP — LIMITED RUN.”**

At their center: the **HEINZ BOTTLE DRONE**, bottle-shaped, camera-eyes blinking.  
Its voice: reverent, void-soft.

**HEINZ BOTTLE (V.O.)**  
Catalog.  
Contain.  
Conserve.

As it speaks, a mist of **preservative spray** drifts down.  
It leaves a sterile tang on the wind — the smell of flavor erased.  
Ketch cringes, muzzle twitching. Mustard bares her teeth.

---

### SCENE 4 — EXT. CANYON RIDGE — CONTINUOUS
The **snowglobe** slips. Cracks. Glitter bleeds.

Ketch freezes — one breath — then **runs**.  
His paws slap grit, a desperate rhythm against the hum above.

---

### SCENE 5 — EXT. FRY DUNES — NIGHT
Ketch vaults into his **shopping-cart buggy**:  
— Roller-skate wheels  
— Duct-taped boom box  
— Broomstick steering column  

Sparks spit from its wheels. The buggy rattles like a carnival ride too long abandoned.

Above: the Heinz Bottle lowers the crate like an altar offering.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**  
Preservation is mercy.  
Without mercy, the tongue dies of choice.

**NETS/TETHERS** drop. Ketch zigzags through exploding fries.  
The air reeks of scorched potato oil and sugar-slick grease.

From the dunes — a RUSTED SCOOTER rockets.  
Atop it: **MUSTARD**, one eye blazing.

**MUSTARD**  
You buying a ticket, mutt — or just whining at the band?

They collide. Awkward. Explosive. Then — together — they pick up speed.

---

### SCENE 6 — EXT. INDUSTRIAL PLATFORM — NIGHT
The Heinz Bottle lands on a glowing platform.  
**ROBOTIC DISCIPLES** in tie-dye aprons hum, bowing. Their humming is off-key, like a broken organ.

Ketch and Mustard cling to a railing. Eyes on the crate.

**KETCH (whisper)**  
That’s it. The last one.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**  
To share flavor… is to invite chaos.

A wave of ketchup fog spreads. **Sticky strings cling** to walls, fur, breath.  
Ketch coughs, choking on sweetness turned rancid.

**SEALS** click. A glow leaks.

Ketch lunges. Jaws clamp on a glowing **ampoule of pink**.  
Drones swarm. Mustard claws in beside him.

**MUSTARD (shouting)**  
You don’t fetch, dog. You reclaim.

They swing over a canyon of beige static.  
The abyss below is silent, endless — like forgetting itself.

**HEINZ BOTTLE (hypnotic, lower)**  
Little relic, pink curdles.  
Beige endures.  
Choose the archive.  
Be remembered. Be embalmed.

Ketch’s teeth clench. He **spits** the ampoule skyward.  
It arcs: **pink, radiant, impossible.**

**MUSTARD (screaming)**  
KETCH… UP!

**SMASH CUT:** **TITLE CARD: KETCH… UP!**

**CUT TO BLACK.**

---

### SCENE 7 — EXT. SERVICE ROAD TO NOWHERE — NIGHT
The buggy rattles down a broken road. Ketch limps. Mustard pushes.

**MUSTARD**  
That stunt? Cute. Almost heroic.  
(beat, softer)  
Don’t make it your brand.

Ketch glances at her. Surprised by the edge of care.  
He almost answers, then swallows it.  
They walk into the neon dark.

---

**END OF ACT I**


## ACT II

### SCENE 8 — EXT. FRYWAY GAUNTLET — NIGHT
The **shopping-cart buggy** rattles onto an abandoned **interstate**.  
Billboards lean over the road like **tilted gravestones**.  
As Ketch and Mustard speed past, each flickers alive in neon static.

**BILLBOARD #1 (hologram waitress)**  
Hungry? Smile for the combo!

**BILLBOARD #2 (cartoon clown)**  
Where’s your receipt? Receipts guarantee salvation!

Mustard squints, steering with one paw.

**MUSTARD**  
Never trust a sign that talks back.

Suddenly — **DRONES descend** in formation.  
Spotlights slice through greasy smog.

**HEINZ BOTTLE (broadcast, void-like)**  
Return the anomaly.  
Tonight the tongue forgets color.  
Tomorrow it thanks me for forgetting.

Ketch swerves between toppled fry-trucks.  
He gasps, eyes wide, fear slipping through the stubborn mask.  
Mustard leaps up a billboard pole, then **kicks** the screen.  
It glitches into warped ASCII slogans.

Other boards **respond**, bickering like gods.

**BILLBOARD CHORUS**  
Why preserve? Why not play? Why not laugh?

The drones hesitate, struggling to catalog dissent.  
Ketch seizes the opening, veering hard left.

**MUSTARD (yelling down)**  
That’s right! Argue yourselves into paperwork!

They blast past the chaos, drones caught in a **debate loop**.

---

### SCENES 9–11 — THE TRIPLE DIP GAUNTLET

#### 9A — SAUCEWAY JUNCTION
The interstate **softens** into a faintly glowing **pink artery**.  
It pulses like a living vein leading deeper into wasteland.  
The ampoule in Ketch’s jaws hums in sync.

**KETCH (V.O.)**  
It’s pointing. Calling.  
(beat, low)  
But to what?

Mustard glares at the glow.

**MUSTARD**  
That’s not a road. That’s a trap with curb appeal.

A voice like warm thunder ripples the night air.

**SAUCE FATHER (V.O., infinite)**  
Ketch… the platter waits.  
The dip is deep.

Pink sauce stains swirl across the road, forming the halo of a **dinner plate**.  
It vanishes.

Ketch stares, transfixed — until Mustard yanks his ear.  
He jolts, blinking back to himself.

**MUSTARD**  
Fine. Let’s follow the glowing artery of doom.  
(softer)  
But if it eats us, mutt… I’m haunting you.

Ketch almost laughs, but it breaks into a nervous pant.  
He takes the lead anyway.

---

#### 9B — EXT. SAUCEWAY — THE MAYO MARAUDERS (SAMENESS)
Engines roar. **MAYO MARAUDERS** crest the hill —  
Biker gang in dripping **white leather**, helmets shaped like squeeze bottles.  
Wheels spray grease like baptism.

At their head: **DUKE MAYONNAISE**, bloated chest daubed **SMOOTH IS PEACE**.

They encircle the buggy.

**DUKE MAYONNAISE**  
Hand over the pink relic. Join us.  
The blandness will keep you safe.  
No spice. No bite. Just… calm.

Mustard sneers.

**MUSTARD**  
Calm? Your silence is sticky.

**DUKE MAYONNAISE**  
The bite divides. Smoothness unites!

The gang chants, loud and pounding:  
**“Smoothness unites! Smoothness unites!”**

Ketch wavers. His grip on the buggy slackens.

**KETCH**  
Maybe we should—

**MUSTARD**  
Don’t finish that sentence.

A whip of mayo nearly slaps Ketch’s ear.  
The buggy fishtails through goo.  
Mustard leaps onto a Marauder’s bike, claws his helmet free.  
He crashes into a **tower of mayo barrels**.  
**BURST.** White goo floods the road.

**DUKE MAYONNAISE (roaring)**  
You will drown in gentleness!

Ketch guns the buggy. Mustard dives back in, dripping.

**MUSTARD**  
If I die smelling like egg salad, mutt—  
I’m haunting everyone.

They skid up a tilted sign and **LAUNCH**, leaving the Marauders in curdled ruin.

---

#### 9C — EXT. CRATER OF THE DIPPING SAUCER — NIGHT (INFINITE VARIETY)
The Sauceway opens into a crater glowing rainbow.  
A crashed **UFO SAUCE DISPENSER** leaks infinite condiments into a shimmering pool.  
Wanderers kneel, dipping endlessly. **THE SAMPLERS.**

**SAMPLERS (chanting, hypnotic)**  
Dip. Repeat. Forget.  
Dip. Repeat. Forget.

A robed **PRIEST** approaches, ladle dripping sauces.

**SAMPLER PRIEST**  
Welcome, stray. Welcome, scar.  
Infinity awaits. Dip once — and you’ll never stop dipping.  
That’s the gift.

Ketch trembles. His eyes glaze.  

**KETCH**  
Every flavor…

He lowers his muzzle.  
Reflected: his old pink **mascot costume**, frozen in a parade grin, eternally dipping fries.  
A crowd cheers. His tail wags once, uncertain. His breath quickens.

Mustard **slaps** the ladle away.

**MUSTARD**  
Every flavor is the same as no flavor.  
It’s noise. And you know it.

The priest recoils, scandalized.

**SAMPLER PRIEST**  
Blasphemy! To refuse the infinite—

**MUSTARD**  
—Is to survive the hangover.

She yanks Ketch back.  
He pants, torn between awe and fear.

**KETCH (whisper)**  
It’d be easier… to stay remembered.

**MUSTARD**  
And rot in sugar? Not my mutt.

Behind them, the Samplers resume dipping.  
The rainbow pool ripples like an eye blinking shut.

---

#### 9D — EXT. VOID EDGE — NIGHT (THE TEMPTATION OF NOTHING)
Billboards freeze. Smog hushes.  
The Heinz hologram flickers at the horizon, whispering like sleep.

**HEINZ BOTTLE (holo)**  
Release. Forget taste. Forget pain.

Ketch trembles. His tongue tastes only **dust**.  
His paw brushes the cracked collar tag.  
He steadies, clutching the ampoule tighter.

**KETCH (V.O.)**  
If nothing’s left… who remembers?

Mustard watches him with a rare flicker of worry.  
She barks sharp, breaking the trance. They push on.

---

### SCENE 12 — EXT. SAUCEWAY / COSMIC OVERLOOK — NIGHT
*(Kept mostly intact: Cosmic Hand scooping galaxies like fries; Mustard grounds it with snark. Ketch whispers, “Tell me it’s real,” half-prayer, half-doubt. Mustard mutters back, “It’s neon weather. Don’t worship clouds.”)*

---

### SCENE 13 — EXT. SAUCEWAY EDGE — NIGHT
Ketch presses his cracked **collar tag** into Mustard’s paw — it glows faintly pink.

A drone lunges for the ampoule. Mustard snarls, bats it away, clutching it despite herself.

**MUSTARD (hissed)**  
Nobody breaks it but me.

The buggy rattles forward. Mustard’s temper snaps.

**MUSTARD**  
You lost your brand, your dance, your pride.  
Now you want some cosmic gravy boat to tell you you’re special?

**KETCH**  
It meant something. It colored lives.

Mustard’s eye burns.

**MUSTARD**  
Colored mine too. In red.  
The *sizzle* — sweet as candy.  
A voice smooth as oil: *“Harmony is sticky, little one.”*  
My mother’s scream tasted like corn syrup.  
The floor was slippery with it.  
I licked my paw for weeks.  
Still taste the **lie**.

She presses the tag back into his paw.  
For a beat, her guard drops.

**MUSTARD (low)**  
Don’t die, mutt. I hate how quiet it’d be.

She leaps into shadow.  
Ketch calls out.

**KETCH**  
Mustard! Wait!

No answer.

---

### SCENE 14 — EXT. FRY REFINERY — NIGHT
The Sauceway delivers Ketch into industrial hell.  
**FRY TOWERS** rain oil. Mascot-workers shovel endlessly.  
Drones swoop. Nets catch him. The ampoule is torn free.

**HEINZ BOTTLE (descending, massive)**  
Efficiency has found you.  
Harmony is sticky, little one.

(Cut: Mustard crouched in shadow. The words hit her like a brand.  
She smells **burnt syrup** again. Her claws tremble. Then her jaw sets. Rage eclipses fear.)

**MUSTARD (snarling, charging)**  
I told you. I still taste the lie.

She barrels in on a stolen **conveyor cart**, rebels clinging behind.

**MUSTARD**  
Miss me, relic?

She crashes through drones. Grease erupts.  
She cuts Ketch free.

**KETCH**  
You came back.

**MUSTARD**  
Don’t flatter yourself. I came back to punch ketchup.

The Heinz Bottle RISES, titanic, body glowing with absorbed anomalies.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**  
Then so be it. The archive declares war.

Tendrils unfurl. Ground shakes.

---

### SCENE 15 — INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER OF CONDIMENTS — NIGHT
Hidden within ruins: a **round table of avatars**.  
**MAYO** (order), **RANCH** (nostalgia), **SRIRACHA** (bite), **NOSTALGIA** (smoky fusion of Relish and BBQ).

They tempt with slogans.  
As they speak, walls drip condiments. The chamber **glitches**.

**NOSTALGIA**  
I’ll keep memory crisp. I’ll bind your heart in smoke.

**SRIRACHA**  
Burn. Prove you live.

**RANCH**  
I’ll smother everything. Safe. White. Eternal.

Ketch falters.

**KETCH**  
Maybe pink isn’t enough.

Mustard SLAMS her paw on the table. Sauce splatters.

**MUSTARD**  
Every one of them wants your leash.  
Different sauces. Same collar.

She yanks him back.

**MUSTARD (cont’d)**  
You’re not carrying pink for them.  
You’re carrying it for everyone.

Ketch steadies.

**KETCH**  
I don’t pick one.  
I fight for them all.

Avatars **glitch**, collapse into puddles.

---

### SCENE 16 — EXT. BILLBOARD PLAIN — NIGHT
The Heinz Bottle looms enormous, blotting horizon.  
Tendrils sweep highways into beige. Rebels rally.

**MUSTARD**  
For flavor!

**REBELS**  
FOR FLAVOR!

The Heinz Bottle unfurls. Ketchup rains like blood.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**  
Then drown.

The sky **cracks**.  
The war begins.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

---

**END OF ACT II**


## ACT III

### SCENE 17 — EXT. SAUCEWAY MUSTER — NIGHT
A battlefield of carts, scooters, and fry-wagons idling under a bruised sky.  
Rebels strap on spatulas and ladles like armor. The **SAUCEWAY** glows ahead — a runway to fate.

Ketch tightens the ragged strap of his collar.  
Mustard checks her bent **syrup wrench**.

**MUSTARD**  
If you leap again, mutt — I’m not scraping you off the pavement.

Ketch almost smiles.

**KETCH**  
I’ll… dance around the dying part.

She snorts — a micro-laugh she won’t admit.  
For a second, he feels lighter.

A shadow spreads. They look up.  
The **HEINZ BOTTLE** rises colossal, body stitched from billboards, ketchup-tendrils uncoiling like storm fronts.

**HEINZ BOTTLE (booming, void-calm)**  
Tonight the tongue forgets color.  
Tomorrow it thanks me for forgetting.

Engines growl. Ketch nods to Mustard. She nods back.

**KETCH**  
We ride through.

They kick off — the charge begins.

---

### SCENE 18 — EXT. SAUCEWAY / WAR OF FLAVORS — NIGHT
Chaos in neon:  

— A **tiny chihuahua in a chef’s hat** skates by on a broken tray, hurling fries like daggers.  
**CHIHUAHUA (barking)**  
Once more unto the breach, dear friends! For flavor!  

Rebels laugh despite dread — morale surges. Humor becomes defiance.

— **Mayo Marauders** lob jars; white bursts against red tendrils.  
— **Samplers** fling rainbow ladles that hiss through drone armor.  
— **Fry-workers** catapult baskets of molten fries like meteor showers.

The Heinz Bottle’s tendrils sweep highways into beige. Color drains in **waves**.

Ketch steers the shopping-cart buggy through collapsing billboards.  
Mustard braces, wrench a metronome of violence.

**MUSTARD**  
(to rebels)  
Drones first! Don’t sermonize the skyline!

**HEINZ BOTTLE**  
Relic. Surrender novelty. Be archived. Be safe.

A tendril lashes down, snaring the buggy’s tail.  
Ketch veers into a falling sign — **SMASH** — severing it.

Mustard glances at him, impressed despite herself.

**MUSTARD**  
Okay, bones. That was almost poetry.

They crest a ridge — and see it:  
Far ahead, a pulsing **VORTEX OF LIGHT**: the **SOURCE OF SAUCE**, pink radiance leaking through reality’s seams.

---

### SCENE 19 — EXT. ASCENT TO THE SOURCE — CONTINUOUS
The Sauceway narrows into a **spiral bridge of light** climbing into the vortex.  
The buggy rattles onto it. Bolts scream. The world drops away beneath them.

The Heinz Bottle hauls itself up the spiral like a living skyscraper.  
Screens across its body flicker propaganda, then stillness — only its eyes remain, winter-cold.

**HEINZ BOTTLE**  
Pink fades. Beige endures.

Rebel engines falter; few can follow this high.  
The fight thins to **Ketch and Mustard** alone.

Mustard steels herself, then — softer:

**MUSTARD**  
Hey. If you leap… I’ll be the one yelling.

Ketch clutches the **ampoule**. It flares, almost blinding.

**KETCH**  
Then I’ll leap toward the sound.

---

### SCENE 20 — EXT. BRIDGE TO THE SOURCE — CONTINUOUS
A tendril slams across the bridge, blocking the path.  
The buggy skids sideways. Sparks arc into the void.

Ketch and Mustard scramble off, paws and claws searching for purchase.

The Heinz Bottle lowers its massive face.  
The billboards that make its skin go black, swallowing reflections.

**HEINZ BOTTLE (near-whisper, everywhere)**  
Be remembered. Not lived.

Ketch stares into the vortex, breath ragged.  
For a heartbeat, doubt shakes him.

**KETCH (V.O.)**  
What if Mustard’s right?  
What if flavor’s just another leash?

Mustard’s one good eye shines, naked, unguarded.

**MUSTARD**  
It matters if we make it matter.

Ketch nods — a vow.

---

### SCENE 21 — EXT. THE LEAP — NIGHT
Tendrils lash, wrapping Ketch’s chest and legs, dragging him backward.  
He refuses to drop the **ampoule** — jaw clenched, veins standing in his neck.

**HEINZ BOTTLE (rising, thunder)**  
Choose the archive.  
Be remembered. Be embalmed.  
A flavorless immortality, but immortality nonetheless.

Mustard **hurls herself** at the tendrils, wrench smashing, claws tearing.  
A tendril snaps — red spray hisses into the star-dark.

For a heartbeat, Ketch is free.

A low hum swells — the **SAUCE FATHER** in the wind.

**SAUCE FATHER (V.O., warm thunder)**  
Leap, child. The platter is waiting.

Ketch runs.  
He runs like a mascot on parade, the old **dance** returning to his bones — a final, defiant flourish.

He **LEAPS**.

Time slows.  
The **ampoule** burns like a star clenched in his teeth.  
Mustard reaches after him, voice tearing the sky:

**MUSTARD (screaming)**  
KETCH… UP!

The word resonates — fractures the clouds — rings like a bell.

Ketch vanishes into the **vortex**.

A **PINK DETONATION** rolls outward — silent, total.  
The Heinz Bottle’s slogans **glitch to nonsense**; its tendrils wither, crumble like sugar glass.

The spiral bridge shudders… then holds.  
Silence.

---

### SCENE 22 — EXT. THE SOURCE — TIMELESS
Weightless pink light.  
Fry boxes orbit like moons; billboard shards drift like quiet asteroids.

At the center: the **SOURCE OF SAUCE** — an endless dip, all colors alive inside it.

Ketch floats. The **ampoule** dissolves into the Source.  
His fur gleams, stained-glass flecks of pink and gold.

The **SAUCE FATHER** manifests — a vast, kind hand of sauce tendrils.

He opens his palm — the cracked **SNOWGLOBE from Act I** rests whole again, the pink bottle inside glowing.

**SAUCE FATHER**  
Some things are meant to be shaken, little nugget.

The snowglobe floats to Ketch. He nudges it with his nose. It **chimes**.

**SAUCE FATHER**  
Well dipped, little nugget.  
Not for pink you leapt today,  
but for choice itself.

**KETCH**  
(soft)  
Did… we win?

**SAUCE FATHER**  
Reset, you have done.  
The platter begins anew now.  
Sauce invites, not saves.

Ketch nods, eyes closing as light folds around him.

---

### SCENE 23 — EXT. RUINED CITY — DAWN
Color seeps back into the world.  
Beige recedes. Reds, yellows, greens return — tentative, then bold.

The **HEINZ BOTTLE** lies shattered, a husk of dead screens and dry glass.  
Drones fall like empty cans.

Rebels rise from rubble, blinking in pink morning.  
Mayo bikers lift helmets, laugh in disbelief.  
Samplers taste the air without dipping.  
Fry-workers hug with greasy hands.

Mustard claws out of debris, coughing.  
She scans the horizon.

**MUSTARD (hoarse)**  
…Dog?

Only wind.

A warm **pink mist** curls around her paw, then fades.

She swallows, jaw trembling once — then sets it.

**MUSTARD**  
Alright, relic. You mattered.

She tosses a single fry into a gutter — the splash sparks the first ripple of returning color.

---

### SCENE 24 — EXT. NEW WORLD SQUARE — DAY
Weeks later.  

A plaza rebuilt from melted arches and PlayPlace tubes, painted in riotous color.  
Children splash in **sauce fountains** (small signs: *DIP KINDLY*). Vendors hawk impossible fries.

At the center: a statue of **KETCH**, mid-leap, jaws set, forever carrying light.

Mustard lingers at the edge, chewing a fry she definitely paid for.  
She eyes the statue, unimpressed on purpose.  
For once, her smirk falters — grief flickers, raw and unhidden.  
She blinks it away, masking with sarcasm.

**MUSTARD**  
Don’t get cocky. Statues don’t fetch.  
(beat, muttered)  
Neither do ghosts.

She flicks the last bite into a fountain.  
Ripples glow pink, then settle to clear.

A breeze passes. Somewhere, faint — a **parade drumline** rhythm.  
Mustard almost smiles. Then turns away.

---

## FINAL TAGLINE  
**“The world didn’t end with a bang.  
It ended with a laugh track.  
And a little pink.”**

---
